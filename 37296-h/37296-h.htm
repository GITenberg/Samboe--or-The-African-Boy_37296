</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It has been justly remarked, &ldquo;that all who read
may become enlightened;&rdquo; for readers, insensibly imbibing the
sentiments of others, and having their own latent sensibilities called
forth, contract, progressively, virtuous inclinations and habits; and
thereby become fitted to unite with their fellow-beings, in the removal
or amelioration of any of the evils of life. With a full conviction of
this, I have attempted, and now offer to my young readers, the present
little work. To the rising generation, I am told, the great question of
the slave-trade is little known; the abolition of it, by our
legislature, having taken place either before many of them existed, or
at too early a period of their lives to excite any interest. Present
circumstances, however, in reference to the subject, ensure for it an
intense interest, in every heart feeling the blessing of freedom and
all the sweet charities of home; blessings which it is our care to
dispose the youthful heart duly to appreciate, and hence to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e204" href="#xd20e204" name=
"xd20e204">vi</a>]</span>feel for those, deprived, by violence and
crime, of these high privileges of man.</p>
<p>It is true, <i>England</i> has achieved the triumph of humanity, in
effacing from her Christian character so dark a stain as a traffic in
human beings; a commerce, &ldquo;the history of which is written
throughout in characters of blood.&rdquo; Yet there are but too strong
evidences that it is yet pursued to great and fearful extent by
<i>other</i> nations, notwithstanding the solemn obligations they have
entered into to suppress it; obligations &ldquo;imposed on every
Christian state, no less by the religion it professes, than by a regard
to its national honour;&rdquo; and notwithstanding it has been branded
with infamy, at a solemn congress of the great Christian powers, as a
crime of the deepest dye. Of this there has long been most abundant
melancholy proof; yet, under its present contraband character, it has
been attended by, if possible, unprecedented enormities and misery, as
well as involving the base and cruel agents of it in the further crime
of deliberate perjury, in order to conceal their nefarious
employment.</p>
<p>Surely, then, no age can scarcely be too immature, in which to sow
the seeds of abhorrence in the young breast, against this
blood-stained, demoralizing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e216"
href="#xd20e216" name="xd20e216">vii</a>]</span>commerce! Surely, no
means, however trivial, should be neglected, to arouse the spirit of
youth against it! It would be tedious, and, indeed, inconsistent with
the brevity of this little work, to name the number of the great and
the good who have protested against, and sacrificed their time and
their treasure to abolish it. Suffice it to say, that an apparently
trifling incident first aroused the virtuous energies of the ardent,
persevering Clarkson, in the great cause;&mdash;that a view of the
produce of Africa, and proofs of the ingenuity of Africans, kindled the
fire of enthusiasm in the noble and comprehensive mind of a Pitt. Nor
did the flame quiver or become dim while he was the pilot of the state,
though he was not decreed to see the success of perseverance in the
cause of justice and humanity.</p>
<p>Let me, therefore, be acquitted of presumption, when I express a
hope, that, trifling as is the present work, yet, as the leading events
it records are not the creations of fancy, but realities that have
passed; that they have not been collected for effect, or uselessly to
awaken the feelings; but having been actually presented in the pursuit
of a disgraceful and cruel commerce, are now offered to the view of my
young readers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e220" href="#xd20e220"
name="xd20e220">viii</a>]</span>in order to confirm the great truths,
that cruelty and oppression encouraged, soon brutalize the nature of
man; divesting him of every distinguishing trait which unites him with
superior intelligences, and sinking him in the scale of being far below
the ravening wolf and insatiate tiger; and that the slave-trade, more
especially, never fails effectually to destroy all the sympathies of
humanity, and so far to barbarize those who are concerned in it, as
assuredly to cause civilized man to resume the ferocity of the savage
whom he presumes to despise.</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;Encourage the chiefs to go to war, that they
may obtain slaves; for as on many accounts we require a large number,
we desire you to exert yourself, and not stand out for a price.&rdquo;
Such was the direction, and such the order, of the slave-merchants at
Cape Coast Castle, to one of their factors in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>interior,
for the collection and purchase of slaves; who, dreadful as was his
occupation, yet at all times faithfully endeavoured to obey the orders
of his employers.</p>
<p>This person had, by studying the character, peculiarities,
prejudices, and language of the natives, obtained a great influence
over the chiefs of a country, peculiarly blessed by Providence, with
all that can enchant the eye, or gratify the wants of man. It is a
well-known, but melancholy truth, that, by the introduction of
spirituous liquors, and other desirable articles to an uncivilized
people, the Europeans have greatly augmented and cherished the dreadful
traffic in human beings: the African kings and chiefs being induced, by
these temptations, to barter their subjects and captives, for
commodities they estimate so highly; frequently even fomenting
quarrels, and making war with each other, at the instigation of the
slave-factors, for the sole purpose of obtaining captives, in order to
exchange them for European articles, with which the factors, who visit
their country for the dreadful purpose, are well furnished; to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>tempt the appetites, and provoke the wild passions,
of the wretched beings they intend to make the instruments of their
inhuman thirst of gain. (<a href="#note.a"><i>Note</i> <span class=

</div>
<p class="first">Mr. Irving, the factor whom we have named as having
received the peremptory and unlimited order from the merchants of Cape
Coast Castle, had won their confidence, by the remarkable success which
had attended his negociations with the king and principal grandees of
Whid&aacute;h, in which delightful part of Africa he had resided for
some years. Nothing, perhaps, more strongly proves the indurating power
of the love of gain upon the heart, and the baneful influence of the
habitual view of oppression on the better feelings of the soul, than
the change which generally takes place in the characters of the young
men whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>official duty places them in situations like that
filled by Mr. Irving. It has, indeed, been most justly and impressively
observed, that it is impossible for any one to be accustomed to carry
away miserable beings, by force, from their country and endearing ties,
to keep them in chains, to see their tears, to hear their mournful
lamentations, to behold the dead and the dying mingled together, to
keep up a system of severity towards them in their deep affliction, to
be constant witnesses of the misery of exile, bondage, cruelty, and
oppression, which, together, form the malignant character of this
nefarious traffic, without losing all those better feelings it should
be the study of man to cherish; or without contracting those habits of
moroseness and ferocity which brutalize the nature.</p>
<p>Irving, like many other youths, had been induced by an ardent
curiosity, and an enterprising spirit, to engage as a writer to the
Royal African Company<a class="noteref" id="xd20e323src" href=
"#xd20e323" name="xd20e323src">1</a>, at a time when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>the traffic
in slaves was legally pursued, as one source of riches to a great
commercial nation. Yet it may with candour be presumed, that he, and
many a youth entering upon the same path, with the same laudable
impulses, had they anticipated the peril to which they exposed their
humane principles, by engaging themselves in a trade so repugnant to
nature, religion, and justice, would rather have undergone personal
hazard and difficulty in their native land, so that they might have
fostered that divine principle, which is the noble and distinguishing
characteristic of man&mdash;of free-born man.</p>
<p>That Irving possessed a native humanity and right feeling, would
appear from his letters to his friends in England, written on his
arrival in Africa; and as he describes the country as it first met his
admiring and youthful eye, it may be not unamusing to my young readers,
to extract a few passages from his letters to his sister, before we
pursue <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>the detail of subsequent events, in which he was an
actor. &ldquo;Well, my dear Sophy,&rdquo; he observes, &ldquo;are you
reconciled to your brother becoming a dealer in slaves? I assure you I
have had some compunctious visitings of conscience upon the subject
during the voyage; the calmness and monotony of which, gave me ample
opportunity of reflecting upon the kind-hearted arguments of my good
little sister, against a commerce, which, I believe she says true when
she asserts, &lsquo;is founded in injustice and crime, and a compound
of all that is wicked and cruel.&rsquo; But, Sophy, what will you call
your wild brother, when I tell you, that the first glance I had of this
enchanting country, put you, your arguments, the unhappy and abused
natives, from my mind, in an instant; and I could only bless my stars
that I was to become an inhabitant of a region which seemed to offer so
many delights&mdash;so many interesting studies for my pencil. I can
anticipate all you would say upon this subject, as to the cruelty of
tearing the miserable natives from scenes which &lsquo;breathe of
Paradise,&rsquo; so as to have raised <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>the enthusiasm of even the
thoughtless heart of Charles Irving. But I have no time for argument,
Sophy, scarcely that for brief description. Imagine then, my dear
sister, the most boundless luxuriancy of landscape, continually clothed
with all the beauties and riches of spring, summer, and harvest; lofty
mountains covered with wood, chiefly fruit-trees; fine streams,
romantic and fertile valleys. Such is the general appearance: the
scenery in detail surpasses description. This charming country seems to
be remarkably populous. The kingdom of Whid&aacute;h, in which is
situated the factory to which I am at present appointed, is (as you
will find on consulting your map) on the western side of Africa,
commonly called the slave-coast. This kingdom we should rather call a
county, as it extends only about ten miles along the coast, and about
seven miles inland. Yet, although of so small an extent, it is divided
into twenty-six divisions, or provinces. The villages are numerous, and
thickly inhabited. The houses or huts of the natives are small; conical
at the top, and thatched either with long grass, or the palmetto
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>leaves. The interior is very clean; but from the
fish and other articles of food kept in them, you may readily imagine
the effluvia is not very pleasant to European nicety.</p>
<p>The furniture of these dwellings is not very costly, seldom
amounting to more than a chest to contain their light and simple
articles of clothing; a mat to repose upon, raised a little from the
floor; a jar to contain water, and calabashes of various sizes; two or
three wooden mortars to pound corn and rice, and a basket or sieve to
prepare it when done. The villages formed of these huts are generally
built in a circle, surrounded by a clay wall, scattered over the
country in the midst of beautiful groves clear of brushwood, and have a
most picturesque and beautiful effect to a stranger&rsquo;s eye. The
fields are always verdant, and nature puts forth her beauties with
inexhaustible profusion; perpetual spring and autumn succeeding each
other. The Company&rsquo;s factory here, is most pleasantly situated in
the midst of gardens, which amply supply it, and the fort, (called
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>Fort William,) consisting of four batteries,
mounting seventeen guns. In these gardens is an abundant supply of
beans, potatoes, every other edible root known in Europe, and a great
variety of delicious fruits peculiar to the climate. Amongst the most
beautiful and useful vegetable riches of Africa, may be reckoned the
plantain and banana trees. The latter bears a fruit six or seven inches
in length, covered with a yellow skin, very tender when ripe. The pulp
of it is as soft as a marmalade, and of a most pleasant taste. It grows
on a stalk about six yards high, the leaves being nearly two yards
long, and a foot wide. One stalk only bears a single cluster of the
fruit, which sometimes consists of forty or fifty bananas; and when the
cluster is gathered, the stalk is cut off, or it would bear no more
fruit. The plantain is not unlike the banana, but somewhat longer,
although the flavour greatly resembles it. The leaves, and every part
of the tree, are converted into a variety of useful articles. There are
also guavas, a fruit very like our peach, except that the external coat
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>is rougher; and it has small kernels like the
apple, instead of a stone. Cocoas, oranges, lemons, citrons, and limes,
abound, and, as you may readily suppose, are in great request amongst
us, as well as beautiful additions to the luxuriant vegetable riches of
the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a subsequent letter he again writes: &ldquo;I was much pleased
this morning to see the natives extracting what we call the wine from
the palm tree, which is beautifully straight and lofty, growing
sometimes to a prodigious height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They make an incision in the trunk, near the summit of the
tree, to which they apply, in succession, gourd bottles, conducting the
liquor into them by means of a pipe formed of the leaves. This wine is
very pleasant when fresh drawn, but is apt to disagree with Europeans
in that state. After fermentation, however, it becomes like Rhenish
wine, and is extremely good, without being prejudicial. You would be
alarmed, Sophy, to see how rapidly and nimbly the natives mount these
lofty trees, which are sometimes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11"
href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>sixty, seventy, and even a
hundred feet in height, and the bark smooth. The only aid they have is
a piece of the bark of a tree, which they form into a hoop by holding
the two ends, having enclosed themselves and the trunk of the tree.
They then place their feet against the tree, and their backs against
the hoop, and mount as quick as thought. It sometimes occurs that they
miss their footing, the consequence of course is, that they are
precipitated with tremendous force to the ground, and dashed to
pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another tree called the ciboa, very much like the
palm, and applied to the same purposes: the wine of this is not quite
so sweet as that of the palm.</p>
<p>In another letter he further observes: &ldquo;I think you will be
pleased to hear in what manner I pass my time here, my dear Sophy,
while you are perhaps talking of me in the dear domestic circle; I will
therefore give you the journal of a day, which, with little variation,
is the general mode of my living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rise by day-break, in order to enjoy the refreshing
coolness of the morning, and generally ride or walk into the country,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>through the delightful woods and savannahs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my return, I breakfast on <i>never-tiring</i> tea, or, for
want of it, a sort of tea growing in the woods, called <i>simbong</i>.
Upon any deficiency of sugar, I use honey, as it is at all times easily
procured; except, perhaps, when the natives are making their honey
wine, of which they are immoderately fond. Sometimes I take milk, with
cakes of rice or flour; or Guinea-corn, baked in a very useful article
in my kitchen; <i>viz.</i> a large iron pot. The milk will not boil
without turning to whey, which I ascribe to the nature of the grass
upon which the cows feed. My dinner is frequently beef, either fresh or
salted, in which latter state it will keep six or seven days. This I
either boil and eat with coosh-coosh, (<a href="#note.b"><i>Note</i>
<span class="sc">B</span></a>.) a favourite dish with the natives, or
with pumpkins and coliloo, like spinach, both of which are plentiful.
Fowls are so cheap and common, that they may always be purchased for a
few charges of gunpowder; and when I wish for either fish or game, I
send a fisher or hunter, allowed by the factory, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>to
supply me; and they never fail to bring me ample store of the finest
sorts of the former; and of the latter, deer, ducks, partridges, wild
geese, and what are here called crown birds, all which abound in their
different seasons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The afternoon is the usual time of trade; but sometimes it is
protracted during the whole of several days, and being my proper
business, I make a point of never neglecting it (<a href=
"#note.c"><i>Note</i> <span class="sc">C</span></a>.) If concluded
early, I sometimes take a trip to some of the neighbouring villages,
and return home to supper, amusing myself, as I am now doing, with
writing or reading, and occasionally visiting two or three friends. In
these visits, the refreshment is generally palm and honey wine, or a
fruit called cola, which very agreeably relishes water. I frequently,
also, form one of a party in shooting doves and partridges. I have
indeed no want of society, generally having even more company than I
desire. These visitors are traders, and messengers from the great men
in this and the adjacent kingdom, who frequently send me presents
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>of pieces of cloths, cows, spices, and even a
slave. These presents I would gladly decline, as I well know they are
given with a view of obtaining more valuable returns, or to bribe me to
some measure in which my interest or aid is required; but I am obliged
to accept what they offer, because the interest of the Company renders
it necessary to conciliate the natives, who may forward the trade. But
to return to my accommodation: perhaps you think I repose on the
&lsquo;verdant mead, under the spreading palm.&rsquo; No such thing, my
dear Sophy: my bed-room is large and airy, and during the rainy season
glows with the cheering blaze of a fire. My bedstead is raised by
forkillas; at the head and feet are cross poles, upon which is placed a
platform of split cane. My bed itself is composed of silk-cotton, a
sort of vegetable down, extremely soft, and very plentiful here; and to
complete my bedstead, I have erected light posts at the corners, to
support a pavilion of thin cloth, as a defence against the musquitoes.
Independently of the linen I brought from England, I have some
presented to me, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>by a negro king and his sister: (what think you of
that, Sophy?) it consists of fine cotton cloths, six yards long and
three wide: these I use for sheets. Thus, you find, I have all my
comforts around me, even on the burning shores of Africa, to which you
were so unwilling I should direct my way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot close my letter without telling you of the pleasure
I enjoyed in my excursion this morning, with a friend who is my
colleague in office, and with whom I am indeed so intimate, that we
have acquired the designation of &lsquo;the inseparables.&rsquo; We set
out just as the day was dawning, and had penetrated nearly five miles
into the country, ere the sun bore any oppressive power; and taking our
fowling pieces with us, we shot a few birds for sport, as we proceeded
through a country rich beyond your imagination to conceive. We rested
ourselves at the foot of a rock, and <span class="corr" id="xd20e394"
title="Source: eat">ate</span> a hearty breakfast of fruit, washing it
down with palm wine, with which we were provided, and milk from the
cocoa-nuts we gathered. We then continued to explore scenes which
seemed to realize the picture <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href=
"#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>imagination forms of Paradise. Coming
to a beautiful expanse of water, we again seated ourselves, to enjoy a
second meal, as well as the beauty and the heavenly repose, adorning
and pervading these vast solitudes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tinkling of several little rills, and the sound of
several larger cascades that fell from the rocks, only broke the
stillness of the spot, in every other respect profound; and altogether
diffused a tranquillity over the soul, the influence of which I still
feel, but am unable to define. The orange and lime trees adorning the
spot, bending under the weight of their delicious fruit, and diffusing
around their fragrant odour; a number of other beautiful shrubs and
trees intermingling their various tints of foliage, and tempting the
hand to gather their rich fruit; combined with the cataracts, the
surrounding hills, covered with the noblest trees and liveliest
verdure, and in their various angles and projections, exhibiting the
bold and free strokes of nature; altogether composed what might,
without exaggeration, be called a terrestrial Paradise, the effect of
which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>cannot be imagined, unless it were seen. You may
be sure that it was not without regret we quitted this delightful spot,
which raised our curiosity and desire, to the highest degree, further
to explore the country. Nor (shall I confess it, Sophy?) could we
forbear remarking, that if the attention of our country was directed to
the civilization, and the improving the natural resources of such a
country, instead of robbing and devastating it, it would be far more
honourable to us as Britains, and as men, enjoying all the privileges
of that envied title. But I think I hear you say: &lsquo;You tell me
much of yourself, and of the face of the country you have chosen for a
residence, but you tell me little of the inhabitants of this favoured
region.&rsquo; This I must reserve for another packet, my dear sister,
as also an account of my visit to Sabi<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="first">Presuming that our young readers are not uninterested
in the accounts of Charles Irving, we shall make a few more extracts
from his correspondence. &ldquo;You tell me,&rdquo; he observes in
reply to the expressed wishes of his sister, &ldquo;you tell me, my
dear Sophy, to give you some information respecting the inhabitants of
Whid&aacute;h. I am myself unable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19"
href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>to speak very decisively, but I
am assured by those who have visited other parts of Africa, that those
of Whid&aacute;h exceed the other negroes in civilization, and they
certainly appear to me, both industrious and ingenious. The women, I
can assure you, are very important personages, truly help-meets to
their lords. They brew the beer, dress the food, sell all sorts of
articles, (except slaves!) at the markets; they are also, I am sorry to
add, employed in tilling the land with the slaves. But, Sophy, this may
be accounted for: the light of Christianity has not yet beamed upon
this land. Its humanizing spirit we have, you know, often remarked, as
peculiarly favourable to the weaker sex; and were Africa free, and
blessed with the genial ray of true religion, doubtless her women would
acquire that consideration which is their due, and be regarded as what
they ought to be, as the companions and solace, not the slaves of man.
In reference to their ingenuity, I have many specimens. They spin
cotton yarn, weave fine cotton cloth, make calabashes, wooden vessels,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>plates, dishes, &amp;c. I have now lying before
me, a present from a great man, a pipe for smoking, which is remarkably
neat. It is formed of clay of a reddish hue, the stem a reed about six
feet in length. It is beautifully and finely polished, perfectly
smooth, white, and even elegant. The bowl and stem are fastened
together with a piece of delicate red leather. It has also a fine
leather tassel, attached to about the middle of the stem; and so neat
is the work, that although the end of the reed goes into the bowl of
the pipe, it appears as if formed of one piece. They clean the reed,
when filled up with the smoke, by drawing long straws through it, and
the bowls, by scraping them with a small sharp instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last week we had quite a gala day, one of the country chiefs
paying a visit to the governor at the fort. He was saluted with five
guns on his landing: I was much pleased that my duty obliged me to go
to the fort at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ostensible motive of his visit, was respect to the
governor; but the real one, to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21"
href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>solicit powder and ball, in
order to defend himself against the attacks of a neighbouring chief. He
assumes the title of emperor, and is a fine model of negro beauty,
young, extremely black, tall, and free in his carriage, with teeth
which rivalled pearls in beauty. His dress consisted of short yellow
cotton trowsers, reaching only to the knees; and a sort of mantle of
the same material, flowing full like a surplice. His feet and legs were
naked; but he wore a very large cap, with a white goat&rsquo;s tail
fastened in it: I suppose, the insignia of his dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the officers of the fort were in full uniform, waiting to
receive this chieftain; and, I assure you, it was a very gratifying
sight to observe the expecting numbers ready to welcome him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and his retinue came in a large and splendid canoe,
containing about sixteen persons, all armed with guns and sabres, with
a number of drums, upon which they beat with one stick. Two or three
women were of the party, and danced to the sound of the drums. They
remained at the fort <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22"
name="pb22">22</a>]</span>all night, highly pleased with the visit, and
the success of it; not only receiving what they solicited, but an ample
present of rum, beads, bugles, and looking-glasses, from the governor,
by which he quite won the hearts of the emperor and his suite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives are, indeed, generally good-natured and obliging,
particularly to Europeans; and if the latter are liberal in presents,
they seldom find the obligation forgotten. If a favour is asked of
them, they will use their utmost efforts to comply, even to their own
prejudice. Gentle measures are, indeed, the only means to succeed with
them: they then seem to have pleasure in compliance; but if treated
with violence, they are obstinate and refractory, and they will take as
much pains to injure, as, in the other case, to serve. This, you will
say, sufficiently proves their native generosity of disposition. Can
such a people require any thing but freedom, and a pure faith, to
render them equal to the European, who despises them, and denies that
they possess a capability of enjoying freedom? I grant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>this, my
dear advocate; and, did time allow me, could relate many instances to
prove that your opinion is just.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my last, I mentioned the employment of the women partly
consisted in weaving fine cotton cloths. We frequently barter these
with our commodities. The pieces are generally twenty-seven yards long,
but never more than nine inches wide. They cut them what length they
require, and sew them together very neatly, to serve the use of broader
cloths. The cotton is cleared from the seed by hand, and is spun with a
spindle and distaff: it is afterwards woven in a loom of very simple
and coarse workmanship. These cloths are made up into pairs, one about
three yards long, and one and a half broad; with this the shoulders and
body are covered. The other is almost of the same breadth, and but two
yards long: this is gathered neatly in folds round the waist, and falls
loosely over the limbs. Such a pair of cloths is the dress of men and
women, with a slight variation in the mode of adjustment. I have seen a
pair of such cloths, so beautifully fine <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>in texture, and so
brightly dyed, as to be very valuable. Their usual colours are either
blue or yellow, some very lively: I do not remember, however, ever to
have seen any red. (<a href="#note.d"><i>Note</i> <span class=

<p>&ldquo;I shall conclude this letter by an account of my visit to
Sabi, as I promised you. With European ideas of the state of society
and commerce in Africa, I confess, the surprise I experienced was very
great, on my entrance into the market of this capital of Whid&aacute;h,
which is kept twice in a week. Great regulation is observed in the
keeping of these markets, a distinct and proper place being assigned
for every different commodity; and the confluence of people, although
great, are preserved from disorder and confusion, by a judge or
magistrate, appointed by the king; and who, with four assistants, well
armed, inspects the markets, hears all complaints, and, in a summary
way, decides all differences among the buyers and sellers, having power
to seize, and sell as slaves, all who violate the peace. Besides this
magistrate, there is another, whose peculiar office it is to inspect
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>the money, which is called <i>toqua</i>,
consisting of strings of shells, to the number of forty; and if one of
these strings happens to be deficient in a single shell, the whole are
forfeited to the king. Round the markets are erected booths, which are
occupied by cooks or suttlers, who sell provisions ready dressed, as
beef, pork, goats&rsquo;-flesh; and others, in which may be obtained
rice, millet, marre, and bread; and others where they sell spirituous
liquors, palm and ciboa wine, and pito, which is a sort of beer. The
chief commodities on sale, are <i>slaves</i>, cattle, and fowls of
every kind, monkeys and other animals; various sorts of European cloth,
linen, and woollen; printed calicoes, silk, grocery, and china; gold in
dust and bars, iron in bars or wrought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The country manufactures are Whid&aacute;h cloths, mats,
baskets, jars, calabashes of various sorts, wooden bowls and cups, red
and blue pepper, salt, palm-oil, &amp;c. All these commodities, except
slaves, are sold by the women, who are excellent accountants, and set
off their goods most judiciously. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>men are also good
accountants, reckoning every thing by the head; and are as exact as the
Europeans are with pen and ink, although the sums are often so many and
so considerable, as to render it very intricate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The slaves are paid for in gold-dust, but other payments are
made in strings of cowries, which, as I have said, contain forty in a
string. Five of the strings make what the natives call a <i>fore</i>;
and fifty <i>fores</i> make an <i>alkove</i>, which generally weighs
about sixty pounds.</p>
<p>The various commodities of these markets, and the order and
regularity with which they are disposed, would be a peculiarly pleasing
sight to a stranger, were not human beings included in the articles of
commerce; but, to behold a number of men, women, and children, linked
together, and ranged like beasts to view, is a sight truly shocking to
behold; and I will acknowledge, Sophy, I felt a sickness come over my
heart, and a glow of shame suffuse my forehead, as I contemplated
upwards of sixty individuals, whom a few short hours, perhaps, might
separate, for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>ever, from their kindred and their country. There
is, however, little chance that it will now ever be otherwise; for the
worst passions of men are engaged, and the despotism of the African
kings gives them ample opportunity to gratify their cupidity and
intemperance, by the barter of their unhappy subjects<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e496src" href="#xd20e496" name="xd20e496src">1</a>. The
revenues of the king of Whid&aacute;h are very considerable; for he not
only has large landed possessions, but he receives a duty on all
commodities sold in the markets, or imported into the country. His
lands furnish him with provisions for his numerous household, as well
as for exportation; great quantities being annually sold to the
neighbouring nations, less bountifully supplied by nature. The revenues
arising from the slave-trade are very considerable, and induce him to
favour it, by the strongest principle in the soul of man, selfishness;
for he receives three rix dollars for every slave sold in his
dominions. Every European vessel also pays <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>him a
pecuniary duty, exclusive of presents, which they make to conciliate
his favour, and to secure his protection in trading.</p>
<p>Some years, slaves to the number of two thousand are brought from
the interior, by the native merchants, most of whom, they say, are
prisoners of war. These merchants purchase them from the different
princes, who have made captives of them. Their mode of travelling is by
tying them by the neck with leather thongs, at about a yard distant
from each other, thirty and forty in a string; having generally a large
truss or bundle of corn, or an elephant&rsquo;s tooth, upon the head of
each or many of them. In their way from the mountains, far in the
interior, they have to travel through vast woods, where, for several
days, perhaps, no water is to be procured. To obviate this distressing
scarcity, they carry water in skins. There are a great number of these
merchants, who, furnishing themselves with European goods from the
slave-factors, penetrate the inland countries, and with them purchase,
in their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>route, gold, slaves, and elephants&rsquo; teeth.
(<a href="#note.e"><i>Note</i> <span class="sc">E</span></a>.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;They use asses as well as slaves to convey their goods, but
no camels nor horses. Besides the slaves brought down to the factories
by these merchants, many others are bought in the vicinity. These are
either taken in war, as the former, or are men condemned for crimes;
and, not unfrequently, they are stolen. <i>These</i> the Company never
purchase, if able to ascertain the fact. It is worthy of remark, that,
since the great demand for slaves, most punishments are changed into
slavery; and there being an accruing advantage on such condemnations,
they exaggerate faults scarcely more than venial, into crimes, in order
to obtain the benefit of selling the criminal. Not only murder and the
grosser crimes are punished in this manner, but every trifling
misdemeanour renders the culprit obnoxious to the same dreadful
penalty. It was not many days since that I had a man brought to me to
be sold, for having stolen a tobacco pipe; and I had infinite trouble
to persuade the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>aggrieved party to accept of a compensation, and
to leave the man free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I have seen of the people, they are well disposed
and cheerful, excessively fond of dancing, keeping it up to the sound
of a drum or a balafeu, for many hours, without any appearance of
weariness. Their dances are sometimes pleasing and regular, but at
others wild, and apparently confused. The instrument they call a
<i>balafeu</i> is very pleasing, sounding something like an organ, when
not too near. It is composed of about twenty pipes of very hard wood,
finely polished: these pipes gradually diminish, both in size and
length, and are tied together with thongs made of very fine thin
leather. These thongs are twisted round small round wands, which are
placed between each of the pipes, in order to leave a short space.
Underneath the pipes are fastened twelve or fourteen calabashes, of
different sizes, which have the same effect of sound as organ-pipes.
This they play upon with two sticks, covered with a thin skin, taken
from the trunk of the ciboa, or with fine leather, in order to soften
the sound. (<a href="#note.f"><i>Note</i> <span class=
"sc">F</span></a>.) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31"
name="pb31">31</a>]</span>Both sexes delight to dance to this
instrument, and their pleasure seems to rise almost to ecstasy, if a
white man will unite in the dance; which, you will readily suppose, I
am never unwilling to do. The only indication of suspicion they show,
is when asked to take any beverage with a white man, always requiring
the liquor to be first tasted by the inviter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of the natives have invited me to their habitations and
dancing parties, and brought their wives and daughters to salute me.
They, with great artlessness, generally sit down by me, and are never
weary in admiring the different articles of my dress; making their
comments one to another, with the most lively admiration and
astonishment. Some, who had never seen a white man, ran away from me,
apparently terrified at my <i>monstrous</i> appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In their persons they are of a good height, well shaped, and
extremely black; and, as an instance of the female subjection, I am
told, that, when a man has been absent from home, even but for a short
time, his wife salutes him upon her knees at his return, and,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>in the same attitude, offers him water and
refreshments. Both sexes are exceedingly cleanly in their persons,
washing themselves in pure water twice in the day, and using aromatic
unguents. Their dress consists of the country cotton cloths I have
named; the superior classes add a short garment, made of taffety, or
other silk, and scarfs of the same material passed over the shoulder.
They generally go with the head and feet uncovered, but occasionally
wear sandals, and caps or bonnets. The superior females wear calico
paans, or a sort of petticoat, which are very fine, and beautifully
variegated with different colours: these are confined round the waist,
and the upper part of the body is covered with a cloth, serving also as
a veil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wear necklaces of coral, &amp;c. agreeably disposed; and
their arms, wrists, fingers, and legs, are encompassed and ornamented
with rings of amber, silver, and even gold, to a considerable value.
The inferior ranks wear copper or iron. The men suffer the hair to
remain in its natural form, except <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33"
href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>buckling it in two or three
places, in order to affix a coral ornament to it; but the women arrange
theirs more artificially, with long and small buckles, or ornaments,
the hair divided on the crown of the head, and the ornaments placed
with great uniformity. They have a bad practice of using an oil, which
injures the glossy blackness of the hair, in time changing it to a
colour approaching green or yellow, which they much admire; but it is
very unpleasing to the eye of a stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have mentioned that the natives of Whid&aacute;h are
idolaters. The object of their worship, you will be surprised to find,
is a serpent; an animal to which men, in general, have an
antipathy<a id="xd20e548" name="xd20e548"></a> This Whid&aacute;h god
is called the <i>fetiche</i>: it is a harmless, as well as beautiful
animal, having an antipathy to venomous serpents, attacking them
whenever it meets with them. The serpent has a large, round, beautiful
head; a short, pointed tongue, resembling a dart; and a short but sharp
tail; the whole adorned by the most beautiful colours, upon a light
grey ground. In general its pace is slow and solemn, except
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>when it seizes on its prey, in which case it is
quick and rapid. They are perfectly tame and familiar, permitting
themselves to be caressed and handled, which is frequently done by the
natives and Europeans, without apprehension of danger. This deity has a
temple to his honour, with priests, sacrifices, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this account we will close our extracts from Irving&rsquo;s
letters; and as they will give some idea of the people of the country
which forms the principal scene of our narrative, it is hoped the
digression will not be thought irrelevant. In the next chapter we
resume the thread of our story, merely pausing to express our ardent
hope, that good may spring out of evil; that even the slave-trade may
be the medium of promulgating the gospel of peace; and that good may,
in God&rsquo;s own time, overcome evil.</p>

<p class="first">Years had elapsed since Irving had indited the letters
from which we have extracted, and every passing one had seen an
increasing tendency to suffer humanity to yield to interest: what had

<p class="first">absorbed the better feelings, which had at first
recoiled from the scenes of cruelty and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>oppression he had
witnessed; and he could calmly execute the one and the other, and be at
no loss to justify (at least to himself) the acts, and even reason upon
the trade of human beings; if not, indeed, upon its humanity and
justice, at least upon its <i>expedience</i>; forgetful of that great
and comprehensive, but most simple maxim: &ldquo;Do unto others as ye
would they should do unto you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The order he had received from his employers, arrived at an
opportune period; for he had, on that very day, been invited to attend
the ceremony of the coronation of the king of Whid&aacute;h, to take
place in a few days, at Sabi. With the true spirit of gain, he
calculated that this event might, by a little judicious policy, be
rendered, not only subservient to his present pressing demand for
slaves, but also might open greater facilities than he had hitherto
possessed, of obtaining a choice. Interest, therefore, united with
curiosity, in his determination of attending the ceremony; a few
preliminaries of which we will name, ere we accompany him to it.</p>
<p>On the demise of a king of Whid&aacute;h, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>crown
descends to his eldest son, unless the grandees have any substantial
reasons to reject his claim; in which case the youngest son is
appointed, provided he was born after the accession of the father. It
is a singular custom, that, as soon as the eldest son of a king of
Whid&aacute;h is born, he is removed from the palace and court, and
placed under the care of a person in private, residing remote from the
latter. With this person he remains, in profound ignorance of his
birth, and of the high responsibilities for which he is designed. His
protector is acquainted with the secret of his royal birth, but would
incur the penalty of death were he to divulge it. By this custom it not
unfrequently occurs, that when a prince is called to the throne, he
may, at the moment, be employed in the most common and menial offices;
and it is with difficulty he can be persuaded to believe those who
inform him of his elevated rank, or in what manner to receive their
servile homage; as it is customary for the subjects to approach the
sovereign in the most humiliating form, advancing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>towards
them in a creeping manner, to a certain distance, till the monarch,
clapping his hands softly, indicates his permission for them to speak,
which they then do, in a low tone, with their heads nearly to the
ground. They retire, with the same slavish ceremonials, from the royal
presence.</p>
<p>As soon as the old king is dead, his successor is brought to the
palace; but the period of his coronation is uncertain, resting with the
grandees, with whom it becomes a political man&oelig;uvre to keep the
government, as long as possible, in their own hands; and they
accordingly fix the period of the ceremony as best suits their
respective interests. It is generally put off some months, and,
sometimes, even years, but cannot be delayed beyond seven years. During
this interval, the government is rather in the power of the grandees
than the king; for they execute all the public acts and business,
without consulting him. In every other respect he is treated as a
prince, with only one restriction, viz. that, previously to his
coronation, he cannot quit the palace. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>It may readily be imagined by our young readers, that, from the
obscure state in which the young monarch is brought up, he has little
notion of those qualities which are necessary to govern a people. On
the contrary, the sudden transition from this obscurity, to the paths
of ease and pleasure, and every facility of self-gratification,
unfortunately gives a peculiar relish for those pursuits and pleasures,
with which, had he become guardedly and progressively familiar, in all
probability he would have been satiated. But this not being the case,
the king of Whid&aacute;h lives almost in a state of indolence; seldom
going abroad, and only occasionally attending his grandees when they
are assembled in the hall of audience, for the administration of
justice: all the rest of his time is spent in the recesses of his
seraglio, attended by his numerous wives, who are divided into three
classes. When the period of the coronation has been fixed by the
grandees, they give intimation of it to the king, who assembles them in
the palace; and the council having deliberated on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>measures
to be used in executing the ceremony, notice of it is given to the
public by a discharge of cannon, and the glad news is soon circulated
throughout the kingdom.</p>
<p>The following morning, the grand sacrificer goes to the king,
demanding, in the name of the great serpent, (their deity!) the
offerings due on such a solemn and joyful occasion. These offerings
consist of an ox, a horse, a sheep, and a fowl, which are sacrificed in
the palace, and afterwards taken to the market-place. In the centre of
this, the grand sacrificer erects a pole, nine or ten feet high, with a
piece of linen attached to it like a flag, and around it are placed the
victims, with small loaves of millet, rubbed over with palm-oil. After
a few trifling ceremonies the company retire, leaving the victims
exposed to the birds of prey; no person being permitted to touch them,
upon pain of death. Arrived at the palace, about twenty of the
king&rsquo;s wives walk in procession to the place of sacrifice, the
eldest, or chief, (<i>Note</i> <span class="sc">G</span>.) bearing a
figure formed of earth, representing a child in a sitting posture: this
she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>places at a short distance from the victims. These
women are attended by a party of fusileers, and the king&rsquo;s flutes
and drums, the people prostrating themselves as they pass, and
expressing their joy by the loudest acclamations. When these ceremonies
are over, the grandees repair to the palace, dressed in their richest
apparel, and attended by their numerous slaves, of whom they are very
proud, adorning them with a profusion of trinkets, and ornaments of
silver and gold. The king is not visible on this occasion; but they
enter, and prostrate themselves before the throne, and again retire.
This part of the ceremony continues fifteen days, during which the
women make the palace re-echo with their acclamations; and the public
joy is testified by the firing of cannon, and the almost continual
display of rockets, from all parts of the capital.</p>
<p>It was during the interval of these rejoicings, that Irving, with
his attendants, arrived at Sabi, and was appointed to take up his
quarters with a grandee high in favour with the new king. He had taken
care to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>provide himself with an ample assortment of
trinkets, spirits, cutlery, and other European produce he knew to be
tempting to his inviter and his royal master, with whom he proposed to
trade, immediately after the ceremony was concluded.</p>
<p>Soon after his arrival, the grandee with whom he resided was
summoned, (as was customary,) as the one deputed to go to the
neighbouring kingdom of Ardrah, with a magnificent retinue, in order to
request one of the nobles of that kingdom (in whose family the right
had existed time immemorial) to proceed to Sabi, to crown the king; and
Irving, desirous of seeing the whole of the ceremonial, obtained ready
permission to accompany the embassy. The greatest respect is paid, by
all ranks, to this officiating nobleman; and all the expences of his
journey are defrayed by the grandees of Whid&aacute;h.</p>
<p>When arrived at the last village next the capital, this nobleman and
his retinue suspended their progress, remaining there stationary three
or four days; during which time he received visits from the principal
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>people of the kingdom, with whom it is customary
to make him valuable presents, and contribute to his amusement by a
variety of entertainments; the king supplying him with a great quantity
of provision, carried twice a day in great pomp, by his wives, preceded
by a guard of fusileers and a band of music.</p>
<p>Among these ladies, Irving saw many whom, as a slave-merchant, he
would have been happy to have obtained at a high price. Four days being
elapsed, the grandees, with their usual train, and a great concourse of
people, repaired to the village, to conduct the Ardrah nobleman, in
great state, to Sabi; where he was received by a salute of the
king&rsquo;s guns, and the loud and continued acclamations of the
multitude. He was then conducted to the apartments prepared for him
near the palace, where he was splendidly entertained by the grandees,
and received visits from the principal officers of the court. He
continued here five days, but, at the close of the third, he entered
the palace with the chief of his train, without taking off any part of
his dress or ornaments. He remained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44"
href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>standing, also, when he spoke to
the king, while all others prostrated themselves, as usual.</p>
<p>On the evening of the fifth day, nine guns were fired, at the
palace, to announce to the people that the king would be crowned on the
following day, and that he would show himself in public, seated on his
throne, in the court of the palace, the gates of which would be left
open for the admission of all ranks of people. It was with the utmost
astonishment that Irving beheld the immense population assembled in the
streets of Sabi, on this occasion; every avenue towards the palace
being completely crowded by the natives, to obtain a sight of their new
monarch.</p>
<p>On the evening of the following day, the king came forth from his
seraglio, attended by forty of his favourite wives, dressed in the most
sumptuous manner; being rather loaded than ornamented, with gold
necklaces, laces, pendants, bracelets, foot-chains of gold and silver,
and the richest gems. The king, who was a good-looking, but,
apparently, very indolent young man, was magnificently <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>dressed,
wearing a gilt helmet, decorated with red and white feathers. He was
attended by his guards, and proceeded from his seraglio to the throne,
which was placed in an angle of the court, to the east of the palace,
and styled the court of the coronation.</p>
<p>The throne itself was something like a large armed chair, finely
gilt, and elevated a little above the ground; the negroes choosing very
low seats, not more than ten inches high, and six in diameter, and not
unfrequently in the shape of an hour-glass. The most valuable and
curious part of the throne we are now describing, was the seat,
consisting of an entire lump of gold; not cast or formed by art, but a
product of nature alone, weighing thirty pounds. It had been bored and
fitted as a seat to the royal throne: upon this was a velvet cushion,
richly laced and fringed with gold, and a foot-cushion to correspond.
On the left were ranged the forty wives of the monarch, and on the
right the principal grandees; and in a line with them, the Europeans
from the English <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>factories; therefore, Irving had a complete view
of every part of the ceremonial. One of the grandees held in his hand
an umbrella: this, however, was more for ornament than use, as the
ceremony took place at night. It was formed of the richest cloth of
gold, the lining embroidered with the same precious material, and the
fringes and tassels the same. On the top of it was the figure of a
cock, as large as the life. The pole of this pavilion, or umbrella, was
six feet long, richly embossed and gilded. Another grandee kneeled
before the king, constantly fanning him during the ceremony. Opposite
to the monarch stood two of his dwarfs, who represented to him the good
qualities of his predecessor; extolling his justice, liberality, and
clemency, and exhorting the king not only to imitate, but to excel him;
concluding their harangue with wishes for the king&rsquo;s happiness,
and that his reign might be long and prosperous.</p>
<p>These ceremonies concluded, the grandee of Ardrah was summoned to
attend. When arrived at the outer gate of the palace, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>cannon
were discharged, and the band began to play. He entered the court,
surrounded with his attendants, and was guarded by them to a certain
distance. He then advanced, singly, to the throne, saluting the king by
courteously bowing the head, but not prostrating himself. He then
addressed a short speech to the king, relative to the ceremony he was
called to perform; and removing the helmet from his head, turned to the
people, holding it in his hands. A signal was then made, and the music
instantly ceased. A profound and most impressive silence ensued. The
grandee of Ardrah, then, with a loud and distinct voice, repeated,
three times, these words to the assembled multitude: &ldquo;Here is
your king: be loyal to him, and your prayers shall be heard by the king
of Ardrah, my master.&rdquo; After this he replaced the helmet on the
head of the king, made a low reverence, and retired. The cannon and
small-arms were instantly fired, the music again struck up, and the
acclamations were renewed. The grandee of Ardrah, in the meantime, was
reconducted, in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>great state, to his apartments; after which, the
new-crowned king, attended by his wives, his guards, and the Europeans,
returned to the seraglio, where the latter made their compliments to
the king as he entered the gate; and, on the following day, the monarch
sent, as usual, a rich present to the Ardrah grandee, previously to his
return home, which he must immediately do, the law not permitting him
to remain three days longer in the kingdom.</p>
<p>The rejoicings which followed the coronation lasted fifteen days,
and the whole was closed with a grand procession to the temple of the
great serpent. The grandee with whom Irving resided during the period
of these ceremonies, was one of the principal officers of the palace,
and possessed a disposition peculiarly open to the enticement of
spirituous liquors, as well as dreadfully acted upon by the pernicious
stimulus they gave to his passions. He also had such a propensity for
their use, that Irving easily found, that, by supplying him well, he
might render him subservient to his purposes; and, in fact, he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>very soon disclosed to the wily merchant, that he
had in his possession a number of valuable slaves, intended for the
service, or to purchase the favour of the young king. The appearance of
this negro courtier was pleasing and imposing. He was, in person, tall
and well shaped; his dress was that usual in the country, but the
material fine, and the colour perfectly white: his cap was also white
and small. He wore large gold earrings, which, together with the pure
white of his light dress, contrasted well with the jet black of his
polished skin. In disposition he was so cruel and vindictive, that when
he received an affront, even in the most trifling instance, he scrupled
not to sacrifice the aggressor by shooting him.</p>
<p>He possessed several wives, of whom he was very jealous, and whom he
treated as slaves. He had also several brothers, to whom he seldom
spoke, or even permitted them to enter his presence; but when he did
grant them admission, they were obliged to take off their caps,
prostrate themselves at his feet, and throw dust on their heads.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p>It may readily be imagined, that a disposition so cruel and
arbitrary, would be stimulated almost to fury and madness by the
powerful influence of ardent spirits; and the fact was, that his thirst
for brandy was so insatiable, that, to procure it, he scrupled not to
execute any act of oppression, cruelty, or treachery. He had even been
known, in order to procure slaves, with which to purchase brandy,
secretly to set fire to a village, and then send the ministers of his
cruelty to seize the distracted people as they rushed from destruction,
to bind and to send them to the European factories, or to the joncoes,
(or black slave-merchants,) and sell them for brandy and rum; which he
would continue to drink till expended, without any cessation but that
forced upon him by stupefaction or sleep.</p>
<p>It would not be consistent with the plan of our tale, to make any
remarks upon the probabilities of what this man might have been, had
not the slave-trade existed; or what direction his cunning and
arbitrary disposition might have taken; but we may venture <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>to say,
that he could not have had so extensive opportunities of oppression,
nor could his cruelties have created such incalculable misery.
&ldquo;For it has been proved, on the most convincing evidence, that
the demand for slaves has had the most fatal effect in exciting and
developing every vice and every bad passion among these people; of
perverting their rude institutions, and poisoning their domestic
relations. It has been proved by evidence unquestionable, that, as we
have asserted, the tyrant chiefs of Africa were daily induced to
condemn, indiscriminately, whole families, for trivial or imaginary
crimes, with the sole object of obtaining possession of the individuals
composing those families, and exchanging them for bad powder and bad
muskets; to station their soldiers in ambush, on the roads, with orders
to rush on the unarmed traveller, and load him with chains; to attack,
at night, villages sunk in repose, dragging into slavery men, women,
and children, of an age suited to their purpose, and mercilessly
butchering the aged and the infant. It has been proved, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>upon
authority equally good, that famine, devastation, and continual
warfare, undertaken for the sole purpose of taking prisoners, were the
inevitable consequences of the slave ships&rsquo; presence on the
coast; and that the Europeans not only were witnesses of this
desolation, but furnished the arms, nourished the hatred, fomented the
discord, and were the communicaters of the moral blast, which shed its
pestilential influence over the population of a country, which, under
the benign protection of a fair and legitimate commerce, is assuredly
capable of being civilized, enlightened, and happy; and which, in
return for the inestimable gifts of instruction and religion, would
cheerfully and gratefully pour its riches into the bosoms of its
benefactors. But, can the arts which embellish life, can the virtues
which expand the heart, can the principles that elevate the soul, can
these find rest, or even enter a region devoted to blood, oppression,
and desolation? Alas! while the slave-trade exists, we are compelled to
unite in the fear expressed by an enlightened patriot, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>that
&lsquo;there is no prospect of civilization or happiness for
Africa.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Intent upon the orders of his employers, and of the
advantages he should obtain by the commission, Irving studied so much
to ingratiate himself with his host, that he very soon readily obtained
his promise of conducting him to his slave-rooms, the first opportunity
he could spare from his close <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href=
"#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>attendance upon his royal master, to
whom his bold and haughty spirit made him eminently useful.</p>
<p>While Irving displayed the tempting assortment of spirits, trinkets,
dresses, and fire-arms, to the eager African, he artfully affected
indifference as to the purchase of slaves; being well acquainted with
the mode of making a good bargain, even when his fellow men were the
articles for which to negociate: so entirely does this infamous trade
debase and corrupt every generous emotion of the heart, and blunt every
honourable feeling. With the internal assurance, therefore, that the
view he had granted of his commodities, would induce the chief, as soon
as possible, to gratify his desire of possessing them, Irving waited
patiently the summons to attend him to the children of misery he had by
fraud and violence collected; and was fully prepared to accompany him,
upon his invitation a few days subsequent to the conclusion of the
coronation ceremonies. Irving was, however, astonished, when the negro
pointed out to him several <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href=
"#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>spacious enclosures, the wretched
inhabitants of which were to purchase his selfish gratification, and
satisfy his cupidity; for Irving was not then aware that this grandee
was, in fact, the creature of his sovereign, acting as an agent and
slave-factor, upon the blood-stained gains of which he not only lived
in great splendour, but possessed from his riches great power. His
house was fitted up with European elegance, and was, in exterior style,
something resembling the buildings of the Moors; consisting of courts,
surrounded by apartments, beyond the precincts of which were the
receptacles of the slaves.</p>
<p>The transition from the elegance and luxuries of this African
mansion, to the slave-buildings, was striking; and to a heart yet
unperverted and unvitiated by the habitual view of uncontrouled power
and oppression over the defenceless, would have been most mournful.</p>
<p>But such was not the impression made upon either of the present
visitants; the one intent upon immediate self-gratification, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>other upon obtaining the means to ensure it in
future. Nothing could more strongly prove the tendency of this traffic
to prostrate every noble faculty of the soul, every tender impulse of
the heart, to destroy every sympathy of our nature, than the fact, that
Irving, the once generous, kind-hearted youth, beheld, with the cold
regard of a mere trader intent upon making an advantageous bargain,
above a hundred and twenty wretched beings in one house, all chained
two and two, by their hands and feet, and sitting in three rows on the
floor! They were of various ages of youth, and different in features;
many of them having come, as the grandee observed, &ldquo;a journey of
many moons,&rdquo; that is, many hundred miles inland.</p>
<p>While examining these miserable captives with all the technical
minuteness of jockeys, or cattle-dealers, (during which the wretched
exiles evinced the strongest and most varying emotions of reluctance,
grief, and indignation,) the people of the chief brought in thirty-five
more individuals, whom they had taken in a small town or village of the
interior, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>and which they had attacked by order of their
employer, leaving the aged and young infants butchered in their simple
huts. Among this last group were several women, who exhibited the most
heart-rending evidences of distraction and grief, in the loss of their
infants, and the prospect of the unknown evils that awaited them in
bondage.</p>
<p>Amongst this number, however, great as it was, there were no slaves
which suited the purposes of Irving; and he proceeded with his
conductor to several other enclosures, from which he selected a few of
inferior value. The negro then told him, he would show him what he
termed &ldquo;prime and superb negroes.&rdquo; In passing over to one
of these enclosures, which were at some distance, Irving was arrested
by a faint and low moan, as of distress, followed by an air of most
exquisite plaintive melody, with which was intermingled, at intervals,
the sound of an infantine voice, so lively as to speak the
unconsciousness, of the innocent from whose lips it proceeded, of the
mournful lot to which it was destined. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What sound is that?&rdquo; he enquired of his host, as he
stopped to listen from whence it proceeded; for even upon his deadened
soul the song had vibrated. (<i>Note</i> <span class="sc">H</span>.)
&ldquo;I dare say it is the Senegal slave I had selected for my royal
master,&rdquo; replied the negro; &ldquo;but she bewailed being parted
from her boy so much, that, to save her life, I was obliged to suffer
her to see him once or twice a day, during the ceremonies. I shall,
however, soon make her submit, now I can attend to her: I shall sell
her for a great price, if I can separate the child from her, without
hazarding her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she will suit me,&rdquo; said Irving; &ldquo;the boy
would be no objection to the purchase, if he is strong and healthy. Let
me see them.&rdquo; The negro hesitated; but at length observed,
&ldquo;They are worth a great deal,&rdquo; as if he doubted that Irving
would be disposed to give the price. &ldquo;You remember that beautiful
sabre, and the brandy-chest full of prime liquor, and those muskets you
admired, and&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;observed Irving carelessly, but was
interrupted in his enumeration by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59"
href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>the African: &ldquo;Yes, yes, I
remember: what! will you give them for her and the boy?&rdquo; &ldquo;I
cannot promise that, you know, unless I see her: you may be telling me
a false tale. It at least can do no harm to see this slave you keep so
close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, true, I scorn to deceive so good a friend,&rdquo;
rejoined the negro, half afraid that Irving would recede from his
implied bargain: &ldquo;You shall certainly see this refractory woman;
that is, she is only obstinate when I remove the boy. I wish they had
killed the young urchin at once, when they carried her off. She is very
gentle when he is with her: she only chooses to sing those mournful
songs about Tumi&aacute;h: I suppose he was her husband. However, at
all events, the boy cannot go to the palace with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this conversation, they had reached the hut in which the poor
slave was confined alone, in the hope of making her yield to the will
of the African, by consenting to be conveyed to the palace without her
child. Irving followed the negro into the hut. The moment the latter
got within it, the miserable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href=
"#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>inmate uttered a piercing shriek, and
clasped her child with convulsive strength to her bosom, imploring the
tyrant not to tear him from her widowed arms. There was one chord in
the soul of Irving, which, amid the circumstances of his life, and
despite of time, yet responded. It was the memory of his mother&rsquo;s
caresses, when in his childhood she became a widow.</p>
<p>The scene he now witnessed, struck powerfully on this chord of
feeling. The distraction of the captive, her extreme youth, her beauty,
the neglect of grief so apparent in her simple dress, her unornamented
hair, her trembling limbs, her heaving bosom, her eloquent eye, her
fevered lip, her attitude, and the energy with which she held her now
alarmed child; altogether, combined a picture, which coming suddenly
upon his previously somewhat softened feelings, had a powerful effect
upon him, and, for a time, made him forget he was a slave-dealer, and
caused the nobler feeling of the <i>man</i> to prevail. He determined,
if possible, to save the wretched woman from the fate that awaited
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>her; forgetting that, perhaps, one equally
horrible might be her lot, did she become his property. When,
therefore, he heard the African tyrant threaten her with a flogging if
she persisted in singing such mournful songs, he almost involuntarily
said: &ldquo;If you are willing to barter her and the child, for what I
named, and a selection of those trinkets you admired, to which I will
add four gallons of rum, we are agreed upon the bargain.&rdquo; The
negro again regarded Irving with a half suspicious, half incredulous
glance, but remained silent. &ldquo;I am serious,&rdquo; said Irving;
&ldquo;are we agreed?&rdquo; &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; muttered the
negro to himself; &ldquo;that <i>fong</i>, (sword,) mounted in silver
gilt, and embossed handle; the chest with fine brandy; ten fine
<i>kiddos</i>; (guns;) trinkets to please <i>woollima moosa</i>,
(handsome wife,) and four gallons of rum: delicious rum make me merry,
happy. Make the rum eight gallons,&rdquo; he added aloud to Irving,
&ldquo;and she,&rdquo; pointing to the being he was thus selling,
&ldquo;she is yours.<span class="corr" id="xd20e767" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span>&mdash;&ldquo;And the boy,
remember?<span class="corr" id="xd20e770" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> replied Irving. &ldquo;O yes, the boy,
the boy, to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>sure,&rdquo; reiterated the African, hardly
knowing how to repress his joy. Though almost absorbed in profound
grief, the wretched captive yet understood she was about to be
transferred, and that her child was to be included in the transfer. In
an agony of mingled emotion, after having timidly regarded
Irving&rsquo;s countenance, while he intently watched hers, she threw
herself at his feet, imploring his mercy, and by a thousand expressive
gestures, imparted the feelings which agitated her soul. In this lowly
attitude she fainted; and when a little recovered, she exclaimed in
mournful accents: &ldquo;O Tumi&aacute;h, where art thou? Thou canst no
more hear thy Imihie: she goes to the land of strangers, and will see
thee no more, till death conveys her beyond the blue mountains. And
Samboe, my boy,&rdquo; she added, as she called the playful and
unconscious child from some flowers he was gathering from the ground,
&ldquo;thou wilt see thy father no more. Thou art a slave, my child:
hard will be thy lot in the land of strangers, among the manstealers,
when Imihie, thy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>mother, no longer shall feel pain, nor endure
bondage. But I will watch over thee, my boy, I will be thy spirit: I
will conduct thee over the blue mountains, the manstealer shall not
follow us there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The negro&rsquo;s anger began to rise, during this soliloquy of his
hapless captive; and calling vehemently for attendants, he directed she
should be conducted, with her child, to a place appointed, with care to
be taken that she should not do herself any injury, until Irving had
concluded his engagement, and could have her removed to
Whid&aacute;h.</p>
<p>Irving declined viewing any more of the slaves on that day, and
having determined to remain but a few days longer with the chief, he
lost no time in making good his purchase of the female slave and her
child. One impediment to his returning to Whid&aacute;h, however, there
was, which he might have anticipated; but in his eagerness to purchase
the wretched Imihie, he had not considered that while the rum and
brandy remained, the grandee and his companions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>were
totally incapable of business; but, in the intervals of stupefaction,
were guilty of the most wanton excesses. Nor was his African majesty
himself, exempt from effects of the potent contents of the
liquor-chests consigned to his favourite, who artfully concealed from
him the circumstance of Imihie; informing the king only, that he had
obtained the liquor from an English merchant, for some dry goods,
ivory, and gum. The monarch enquired if this merchant traded also in
slaves. &ldquo;Doubtless he does,&rdquo; replied the wily courtier:
&ldquo;he comes from the land of the manstealers, and will not,
therefore, refuse the commodity in the way of trade. Would my royal
master wish to see this Englishman?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is my
desire,&rdquo; answered the king; &ldquo;let him have notice of our
pleasure.&rdquo; The grandee prostrated himself, and retired to caution
Irving to conceal the transaction of the female slave from the king, or
he would doubtless force her from him. The morrow was appointed for the
interview with the monarch, who, the courtier <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>said,
had some slaves to offer for brandy and trinkets for his wives.</p>

Providence, showered on the globe we inhabit, for the general use,
benefit, and pleasure; and of those embellishments of art, which
civilization has brought forth and nourished.</p>

<p>It may be urged, we are not the original agents in this trade: it is
pursued with eagerness by the Africans themselves. But are those who
live in that transcendent light which was granted to dispel the mists
of error&mdash;to meliorate propensity to evil&mdash;to harmonize the
rational soul&mdash;still to delight in works so dark, still to trample
under foot every principle of humanity; still to spurn from them the
obligations of justice, still to set at naught the precepts of
religion; and to make themselves accomplices with pagan oppressors, in
tyrannizing over those hapless beings, whom a mysterious Providence has
subjected to their power? Is the Christian trader content to put
himself upon a level with the unenlightened despot, and coolly to put
his blood-stained profits in the balance, against the laws of religion

before which the oppressed and the oppressor shall alike appear!</p>
<p>But to return to our narrative from these reflections, which the
seriousness of the subject forced from us, and which must apologize for
them with our young readers.</p>
<p>The time being fixed for Irving to have an audience with the king,
he was conducted to the palace, which was a spacious edifice,
consisting of many large courts, entirely surrounded with porticoes,
above which were apartments with small windows. These apartments, as
well as every part of the palace, exhibited great magnificence in the
furniture and decorations. Some of the floors were covered with
exquisitely fine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>matting, and others with superb Turkey carpets;
and the furniture consisted of chairs, sofas or divans, skreens,
chests, cabinets and porcelain imported from China. The windows were
not glazed, but were shaded with frames of fine white linen, and
taffety curtains. The gardens of this superb palace were very
extensive, laid out in long vistas of lofty and beautiful trees;
affording a deliciously cool and shaded retreat, for the women immured
in the splendid prison. It was evident to Irving, as he passed some of
these apartments to the hall of audience, that his African majesty
intended to receive him in great state; but whether out of respect to
him, as a European and <i>a slave and spirit</i> merchant, or to
display his own magnificence, he could not determine: nor was it of
much consequence, although he well knew that the Europeans in general
are well received, and are allowed to dispense with the humiliating
ceremonies they scrupulously exact from their own subjects; and, unlike
them, are granted an audience whenever they desire it. When Irving,
therefore, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>entered the hall where the king was seated to
receive him, his majesty immediately rose, and advanced some steps to
him; took him by the hand, pressed it in his own, and three times
successively touched his fore finger, which was the greatest token of
amity and affection. After this, he desired him to sit down by his
side, upon fine mats spread on the floor; which Irving having complied
with, he displayed his presents to his majesty, who was astonished to
find he could, with ease, converse with him without the aid of an
interpreter.</p>
<p>Irving could not but feel gratified at the extreme although childish
pleasure the young monarch evinced, in receiving the presents; which
consisted of an elegant case of English spirits, some beautiful guns, a
superb sword, and a great variety of trinkets for the ladies of the
seraglio. The king offered to sell him some of his discarded wives; but
Irving respectfully declined the offer of the ladies, as not very well
calculated for the labours of the colonies.</p>
<p>In the audience chamber were two benches, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>one of
which was broader than the other, covered with an embroidered cloth,
and by it was an oval stool; upon this the monarch seated himself,
after having received and examined the presents. The other bench was
covered with mats, on which Irving was directed to sit, as the usual
seat of the Europeans during conferences. Irving was uncovered; not,
however, by order, but from a voluntary desire of showing proper
respect; for he had not forgot the early lesson, &ldquo;honour the
king,&rdquo; though as a slave-dealer, it may be, alas! inferred, that
he had little recollection of the context, &ldquo;fear God.&rdquo; He
made himself so agreeable, however, to the king, that he was invited to
dine with him, and the meal was served with great elegance. While they
were feasting, the grandees prostrated themselves before their
sovereign; and what provisions were left were given to them, which they
appeared readily and cheerfully to accept. Irving had, during this long
interview, an ample opportunity of observing the person, the dress, and
the manners of the new king of Whid&aacute;h; and, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>in some
degree, to form a judgment of his character. His dress was superb,
composed of silk and gold, with strings of beautiful coral round his
neck, arms, and wrists. In person he was tall, well shaped, with
remarkably smooth and polished skin. His manners were free, urbane, and
familiar; but there was discovered a disposition to covetousness, and
the usual propensity to inebriety. Nor was it difficult to discover
that he was indolent and pusillanimous, the usual companions of luxury
and dissipation. In fact, the faults of the king seemed those of his
education; and his virtues, those of his nature, which required only
civilization, good examples, and a pure faith, to nourish into
fruitfulness.</p>
<p>The audience chamber in which Irving was received, was hung with
tapestry. At the upper part of the room was a throne, formed of ivory;
it was ascended by three steps, and shaded by a canopy of the richest
silk. This is used on great state occasions.</p>
<p>The king readily granted permission to Irving, to view the palace,
excepting, of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>course, the apartments of the women. Conducted by
his friend the grandee, and some other officers of the palace, he found
it more extensive than he had supposed, having entered by a private
passage. It consisted of several large squares, surrounded with
galleries, each of which had a portico or gate, guarded by soldiers.
The first gallery on entering the palace is very long, supported on
each side by lofty pillars. At the termination of this gallery was a
wall with three gates, the centre one ornamented with a turret seventy
feet in height; terminated with a figure of a large snake, cast in
copper, and very ingeniously carved. These gates opened into an immense
area, enclosed also with a wall; then another gallery like the former,
into another spacious court; and so on to a fourth, beyond which were
the apartments of the king. In this spacious palace the king is
sometimes immured for years, until he is crowned; and here, also, many
wealthy courtiers spend the whole of their time, leaving trade and
agriculture to be executed by their wives and slaves. (<i>Note</i>
<span class="sc">K</span>.) These <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74"
href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>go to the circumjacent villages,
either to trade in merchandise, or serve for daily wages; but they are
obliged to bring the greatest part of what they obtain to their
masters, otherwise they make no scruple to sell them for slaves.</p>
<p>Irving and his new royal acquaintance had passed their time so
convivially, that the negociation for slaves was deferred till the
morrow, when he again attended his majesty to a dep&ocirc;t, containing
about two hundred; and as they were going to this place, they met
nearly as many proceeding to the coast, the king&rsquo;s agents having
sold them on the preceding day. Amongst this wretched group, Irving
remarked some remarkably handsome men; and found, on enquiry, they were
from Molembo, from whence the finest negroes are obtained.</p>
<p>The number he was invited to examine, consisted of men, women, and
children; and, to any but a slave-dealer, the sight was heart-rending.
Fathers overwhelmed in silent sorrow; mothers expressing their anguish
in affecting lamentations, audible sighs, or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>deep
groans, expecting every moment to be separated from their tender
offspring, whom they clasped to their bosoms, or endeavoured to hide
under the folds of their pacans; youthful females shrinking from the
brutal gaze of the trader, and dreading nameless indignities; the fiery
eye of many a youth, indignant at the bonds which confined him from
levelling to the ground the wretches who bought and sold him as a beast
of the field, and tore him from the object of his love, whom he was
powerless to save from death and bondage. But such a scene was of too
frequent occurrence, the cry of the innocent was too familiar, to make
any impression upon those who were bargaining. Irving purchased many of
them; and having seen them marked as his property, (<i>Note</i>
<span class="sc">L</span>.) left his people to conduct them to
Whid&aacute;h; whither, after having taken a cordial leave of the king,
and so far conciliated him and the grandee as to ensure future
advantages, he himself, with his attendants and the female slave,
returned that evening. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76"

<p class="first">It will naturally be supposed, from the eagerness of
Irving to make good the purchase of Imihie and her poor boy, that his
heart was deeply interested by their situation, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>and that
he had it certainly in his power to ameliorate it. But, alas! if, for a
moment, the chord of compassion was touched, the feeling was transient,
the impulse too weak to prompt to action; and, so far from being
strengthened by the night&rsquo;s reflections, they, on the contrary,
did but lead to lament his own folly, in making himself liable to the
loss he would probably sustain by the high price he had given; as it
was a condition of his engagement with the Company, that he was to be
individually accountable for all losses incurred by the purchase of
unprofitable slaves. These anticipations of pecuniary injury, were
confirmed by the appearance of his poor captive on her arrival at the
dep&ocirc;t at Whid&aacute;h. A fixed melancholy seemed to have
absorbed every faculty, rendering her insensible even to the playful
caresses of her boy, in whose sparkling eye, health &ldquo;seemed a
cherub yet divinely bright;&rdquo; so happily unconscious was he of the
bitterness of his lot, and the sufferings of his mother. Finding, from
his people, that she resolutely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78"
href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>rejected sustenance, Irving
himself endeavoured to persuade her, but without success; but when
self-interest, aided by the dictates of conscience and compassion,
induced him to resort to the usual mode of forcing it, (nor will we
question it was a painful task to him,) his heart must have been of
adamant, not to have felt the powerful appeal of wretchedness and
despair, when, while in the execution of this cruel duty, the poor
captive looked up in his face, and, with a mournful smile, said:
&ldquo;Presently I shall be no more.&rdquo; (<i>Note</i> <span class=
"sc">M</span>.) Irving, indeed, from her appearance, began to think so;
and as he could not now remedy her situation, nor restore her to what
she had lost, he considered his best plan was to consign her, as soon
as possible, to the ship waiting to receive the collected slaves,
congratulating himself on his <i>humanity</i>, in having prevented the
mother and child from being separated, even if he should thereby
sustain some loss. He determined, also, to do all he could to ensure
her some attention during the passage; and, with this view, determined
to go immediately <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79"
name="pb79">79</a>]</span>on board, to see the accommodation, and to
give some particular instructions to the captain; leaving orders that
Imihie should be conducted to the ship as soon as the day began to
close.</p>
<p>The ship destined to convey these miserable beings to the West
Indies, had already on board between four and five hundred negroes. The
captain boasted much of the superior accommodation of his vessel for
the trade; and, to confirm his assertion, entreated Irving to visit the
slave-rooms. Willing to conciliate any who might promote his interest,
Irving consented. The <i>superior</i> accommodation he found, was, that
every slave, whatever his size, had five feet six inches in length, and
sixteen inches in breadth, to lie upon! The floor was crowded with
bodies, stowed or packed according to this allowance. But between the
floor and deck, or ceiling, were platforms or broad shelves, in the
mid-way, which were also covered with bodies. (<i>Note</i> <span class=
"sc">N</span>.) The men were shackled two and two, each by one leg, to
a small iron bar; these, the captain with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>much self-complacence
said, were every day brought upon deck for the air; but lest they
should attempt to recover their freedom, they were made fast by
ring-bolts to the deck, or by two common chains, which were extended on
each side the main deck; but the women and children, he added, were
suffered to remain loose. Few slaves fared so well as his, he
continued, for he allowed each a pint of water a day, and yams and
horse-beans twice a day; and afterwards, for exercise and health, they
jumped in their irons, which, if they refused to do, he was obliged,
certainly, to flog them, as it was his duty to preserve them in health,
if possible. Irving, however, learnt, in the course of this man&rsquo;s
conversation, that it was usual for these miserable beings to remain
fifteen or sixteen hours below deck, out of the twenty-four; and that,
in wet weather, they could not be brought up for two or three
successive days: their situation was, he acknowledged, very
distressing, but he could not remedy it. They would cling to the
gratings for a little air; draw their breath with anxious and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>laborious efforts; fight with each other for a
taste of water; and many died of suffocation. (<i>Note</i> <span class=
"sc">O</span>.)</p>
<p>Amongst the number thus confined in the hold of this ship, Irving
remarked many whose nobleness of aspect indicated that there was a
&ldquo;spirit within,&rdquo; which rose even above such
calamity&mdash;a consciousness of moral dignity, that spurned at the
cruelties of the oppressor; but there was one in particular, before the
flame of whose eye even Irving shrunk abashed. He was evidently a
person of consequence; high, it would seem, in military rank, inferred
from certain personal indications, with the meaning of which Irving was
acquainted; and also from some articles of dress, stated to have been
taken from him when captured; and every look (action was denied him)
indicated that he possessed a mind not insensible to the eminence of
his station. Irving enquired from whence he was taken, and from whom
purchased? He was told, from Molembo, it was thought; and that he had
been only a few days purchased from the king of Whid&aacute;h, with a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>number of his countrymen, taken by treachery, and
in defiance of a treaty subsisting at the time. This was all he could
learn; and having given his instructions respecting Imihie, Irving
returned to Whid&aacute;h before her arrival at the ship, being
desirous to avoid another interview, the sight of her producing a
painful emotion he could neither define nor account for.</p>

<p class="first">Night shed her silent influence over the mighty deep;
the firmament was bright with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href=
"#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>myriads of glittering worlds; the
moon, in full and mild lustre, rode majestically, like a sphere of
silver light, on the summit of fleecy clouds, and was reflected, in
many a fantastic form, by the tossing waves, the gentle ripplings of
which were mingled with the distant sound of &ldquo;All is well,&rdquo;
borne on the gale from the fort, the regular tread of the watch on
deck, and the boatswain&rsquo;s shrill whistle. The rush of the shark,
&ldquo;cutting the briny deep,&rdquo; as it instinctively followed the
floating receptacle of misery, was the only sound that interrupted,
painfully, the heavenly calmness of the scene and hour; a calmness,
alas! little according with the soul-sickening agitations of the
wretched beings, now silently borne from all held dear and precious,
and on their way to all the horrors of a life in chains. Cargoes of
despair they may truly be called!</p>
<p>Imagination, in its loftiest flight, must come short in attempting
to embody in words, the smallest part of the aggregate of misery which
exists on board a slave-ship; it will, therefore, not be attempted: one
only being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>of the wretched number must appear a moment on our
theatre of woe; he who had so forcibly arrested the attention of
Irving, when visiting the slave-rooms.</p>
<p>Confined promiscuously with such a multitude of his wretched
countrymen, the agony of his feelings is not to be described. With the
form and visage of a man, he felt, indignantly felt, that his destiny
was that of the beast of the field, and his soul seemed bursting from
the frame that confined it. Wearied nature at length found a short
cessation from the unutterable pangs of woe, in sleep&mdash;in
consoling visions! He dreamt he was in his own beloved country, in the
enjoyment of honour and command, caressed by his family, served by his
wonted attendants, and surrounded with the comforts of his former life:
his spicy groves exhaling sweets, his palm-tree&rsquo;s refreshing
shade, his rivers teeming riches, his domestic endearments, his
war-like preparations, and his hard-earned triumphs, came in succession
on his fancy. But the sweet delusions were too soon dispelled: he
awoke, with a hurried start, to the sad, sad reality, that he was a
slave in the midst <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85"
name="pb85">85</a>]</span>of slaves. The rapid retrospect of former
happiness with existing misery, rushed on his soul; and the dreadful
reverse drew from his manly breast the most affecting lamentations.
Every dear object of his regard flitted before his mental view; but,
alas! there was no reality but misery&mdash;interminable bondage: there
was no fond eye to behold, no persuasive tongue to soothe, no attentive
ear to listen to his woe. Mingled with the meanest of his subjects,
whom he had no power to relieve; subjected to the cruelty and insolence
of wretches a thousand degrees lower in the scale of humanity and
intellectual endowment, yet arrogating their superiority as Christians,
and the proud distinctions of national advantages, his soul refused
comfort, and he determined upon death. Little did he think this foe to
nature was so near; little did he imagine the horrid form in which he
would present himself; and that there might be circumstances which, at
the moment of expiring nature, would make him cling to, and even give
value to a life of perpetual bondage! <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>The vessel made considerable way during the night, and the morning
rose, with glorious splendour and beneficent freshness, upon the world
of waters; on the majestic bosom of which, floated such an accumulation
of moral turpitude and excelling misery! The hour arrived when the
slaves were to be brought on deck for air and exercise. The sable
warrior anticipated it with a gloomy joy, as the most favourable
opportunity of effecting his designed purpose of self-destruction; and
when he found he was to be fastened to the deck, he violently resisted.
This, however, did but provoke his oppressors to increased indignities.
In the midst of this struggle, he became calm as a lamb, resistless as
an infant. The sound of a female voice, singing a mournful African air,
seemed to have bound him by a potent spell<span class="corr" id=
"xd20e1020" title="Source: ,">.</span> (<i>Note</i> <span class=
"sc">P</span>.) His eyes appeared as if bursting from their orbits, his
whole frame trembled; while the big tear rolled silently down his sable
countenance, which assumed a mingled expression of doubt, hope, and
agony. He at first directed his piercing eyes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>to the
air, as if he thought the song proceeded from some hovering, viewless
spirit. He again renewed his efforts to get free, and fixed his gaze
intently on the remotest part of the ship, from whence the sound seemed
to proceed, but nothing met his view: the song, however, still
continued, only interrupted, at intervals, by deep sobs of anguish, and
the scarcely-heard voice of infantine distress.</p>
<p>Rendered desperate by the confinement under such powerful emotions,
he called loudly on the spirits of his fathers, to avenge him on the
Christian tyrants; and while enduring, in consequence, the cruel
scourging and insulting mockery of the barbarian crew, a piercing
scream was heard, and the poor Imihie was seen rushing from an obscure
place, (in which the captain had indulged her to remain,) with the
infant Samboe clinging to her bosom. In a moment the names of
Tumi&aacute;h! Imihie! were interchanged; and the exhausted Imihie,
letting her child fall from her relaxing arms, threw herself upon
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>the panting bosom of her enchained and manacled
husband.</p>
<p>We invade not the feelings of that moment: language has nothing to
do with them. The Being who formed the heart of man, can alone judge of
its emotions.</p>
<p>The maternal affection was not, however, long absorbed in the
conjugal; and the half frantic Imihie recollected, that Samboe was not
enfolded with her in the arms of Tumi&aacute;h. She loosened herself
with difficulty from his embrace, to restore her child to his wonted
protection within her own; but, at the moment she arose for the
purpose, a tumultuous cry resounded through the ship, of &ldquo;fire!
fire! Loosen the slaves! loosen the slaves!&rdquo; The fire, however,
spread with such violence, bursting from the spirit-room, that the
sailors, apprehending that it was impossible to extinguish it before it
would reach a large quantity of gunpowder on board, concluded it
necessary to precipitate themselves into the sea, as offering the only
chance of saving their lives.</p>
<p>However, they did first endeavour to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>loose the chains by which
the slaves were fastened to the deck; but in the confusion the key
could not be found, and they had but just time to loosen one of the
fastenings, by wrenching the staple, before the vehemence of the fire
so increased, that they simultaneously jumped overboard; when
immediately, the fire having gained the powder, the vessel blew up,
with every slave that was confined by the unloosened chain, and such
others as had not possessed the power to follow the example of the
sailors.</p>
<p>We hardly know whether to style it fortunate, that any circumstance
should save these victims of avarice from a watery grave, after
escaping that which, to the sense, seems more terrible. Providence,
however, ordained that there should be some vessels in sight; which,
putting out their boats, took up about two hundred and fifty of the
poor souls that remained alive; but the most of them being those who
had been fastened together with shackles, had, from the violence of the
shock, and the confinement of the irons, experienced dreadful fractures
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>the limbs; which, inflamed by the struggles they
had instinctively made, the heat, and the agitated state of the blood,
quickly mortified, and ere they were scarcely sensible of their
increase of calamity, released them, for ever, from all fear of it
more. Among the number who thus yielded up his manly spirit, was
Tumi&aacute;h, rejoicing in the belief that his Imihie and Samboe were
also removed to a land of spirits&mdash;a land where no man-stealer can
enter, no treachery gain access, no violence invade. He might have
adopted the words of the poet:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Now, Christian, glut thy ravish&rsquo;d
eyes;</p>
<p class="line xd20e283">I reach the joyful hour:</p>
<p class="line">Let, let the scorching flames arise,</p>
<p class="line xd20e283">And these poor limbs devour.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;O Death, how welcome to th&rsquo; opprest!</p>
<p class="line xd20e283">Thy kind embrace I crave;</p>
<p class="line">Thou bringst to Misery&rsquo;s bosom rest,</p>
<p class="line xd20e283">And freedom to the slave!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">The fond belief, however, of the expiring
Tumi&aacute;h, that his wife and child had escaped the horrors of
bondage, was fallacious. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href=
"#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>Previously to the calamity, the
feelings of the wretched Imihie had been wrought up nearly to their
utmost height; the sight of the quick-advancing flames, therefore, was
sufficient to augment them to frenzy, and with a strength which frenzy
only could impart, to a frame exhausted by want of nourishment and
continual grief, she snatched the infant Samboe from the deck, upon
which he had fallen, and where, unheeded by one pitying eye, he
remained, without uttering any cry or attempting to move; for, overcome
by terror of the noise and brutality of the crew, the sight of the
immense ocean, and the want of that nourishment which he in vain sought
from the exhausted bosom of his wretched mother, the suffering child
seemed unable to move, or even to utter any sound.</p>
<p>Imihie pressed him closely to her breast, turned a momentary and
frenzied glance upon her enchained husband, and uttering a faint cry of
terror, cast herself and precious burden into the foaming deep. But it
was not decreed to become her tomb. Almost <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>by
miracle, she was thrown near a boat which had put off from a Spanish
slave-vessel, and was picked up by the crew, with Samboe still closely
entwined within her arms; without, however, exhibiting the smallest
appearance of remaining life. But the vital spark was not yet extinct.
She was immediately put on board the ship, and means of resuscitation
used with both her and her child, as well as several other equally
miserable victims of avarice. Heaven decreed these efforts to be
effectual: and thus was the widowed mother transferred, by the sudden
calamity, from one set of mercenaries to another, yet still doomed to
slavery! The vessel had taken in her cargo at Rio Pongos, and was bound
for the Havannah; but her stowage was too small to allow her, with
impunity, to keep the increase occasioned by the casualty of the fire.
She therefore put into a port, and disposed of them to a ship bound for
Jamaica. This occasioned considerable delay; in consequence of which,
when the transferred slaves were at length on their passage, they were
subjected to all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>the evils of improper seasons; water failed,
provisions became spoiled and scanty, and many of the slaves the
victims of disease, ere they entered the magnificent harbour of Port
Royal.</p>
<p>Arrived at Kingston, they were put in <i>store</i>, until notice
should be given of sale, which was immediately done by advertisement:
&ldquo;On Tuesday next will be put up for sale, in their store, fifty
superb negroes of the coast; to the purchasers of which will be
afforded all the facilities wished.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Had Irving now seen the once attractive Imihie, and
her playful boy, as he even beheld them in the slave-room of the
African courtier, he would scarcely have given credit to any assurance
that she was the same individual. She then, recently a captive,
peculiarly displayed in her person the characteristic feminine traits
of her country&mdash;perfect symmetry of proportion, and beautiful, in
as far as it did not consist in colour. Modest, affable, and faithful,
these sweet feminine qualities emanated from her softened eyes, and an
air of winning innocence in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href=
"#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>every look and gesture; while every
word was pronounced with an inflection of voice so sweet, so soft, so
tender, that cold indeed must have been the heart that could withstand
its eloquent appeal, or listen, unmoved, to its modulations. Such was
the young Imihie. Now, alas! how changed! Emaciated for want of food,
sinking with illness, shrinking from exposure; almost frenzied with the
recollection of the past, the misery of the present, and the dread of
the future; bearing, with difficulty, her infant, she was conducted,
with her companions in misery, to the vendue, in the bare hope that she
might be purchased for the sake of the boy; who, though suffering from
the effects of the voyage and want of his natural nutriment, still
evidently displayed great intelligence, and much natural vigour. The
first day of exhibition passed, and no purchaser was found for the
<i>sulky</i> negress, (for such is the feeling term applied to the
desponding.)</p>
<p>On occasions like this, it is a common thing to speculate upon the
purchase of what are termed the refuse negroes, or those <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>left
from the first day&rsquo;s sale. Some are frequently in so weak and
miserable a state, as even to be sold as low as for a dollar; some are
taken to the mart almost in the agonies of death; and some are even
known to draw their last sigh in the piazzas of the vendue master. It
was on the second day&rsquo;s sale that Imihie was purchased by a
planter for a very low sum, and carried into the country, with some
others, whom he intended to retail. The situation of these wretched
captives was but little ameliorated, by becoming the property of this
man, who was of that class of managers, who think that the safety of
the family to which they are subservient, and the interest of the
proprietor, renders severity indispensable, and oppression the only
mode of subduing the refractory spirit of the African, whom they regard
with the most sovereign contempt. With souls lost to all sense of
compassion, they believe there can be but one mode of enforcing
obedience, that of fear; and in the exercise of their delegated
authority, they put in action, to the utmost, this ignoble <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>stimulus, by every means which a spirit of cruelty
and ignorance can suggest.</p>
<p>Short, indeed, would have been the existence of the miserable
Imihie, had she continued the property of this semi-barbarian. Confined
in a narrow and unwholesome hut, without a single comfort; a hurdle for
a bed, which rather served to torture than to ease her pained and
wearied limbs, with scarcely sufficient of a coarse linen to secure her
frame from the scorching heats of the day, and the dangerous dews of
night; in the midst of the richest bounties of nature, and the abundant
luxuries of art, fed on salt beef and salt cod, and roots, with the
injurious flour of the cassava, imperfectly prepared, and these in
quantity scarcely sufficient to support existence; deprived of every
enjoyment; condemned to perpetual labour, under the rod of an unfeeling
master, there could be no chance of amendment of health, or of
reconcilement to her destiny. But Providence ordained she should yet
feel the happiness of sympathy. Her tyrant master, finding that her
labour was very inadequate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href=
"#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>to the expences of retaining her,
would have separated her from her child, and sold her for the smallest
possible sum; but a neighbouring proprietor of a small plantation
offered a satisfactory price for them together, and they were removed
to a comparatively comfortable situation, in the hope that, with rest
and better food, she might be enabled to become a house-slave to the
wife of the purchaser.</p>
<p>It has been remarked, by observing travellers, that the women of the
West Indies possess great natural kind feelings; but that the habitual
view of oppression, and the free exercise of power over the slaves,
renders them very insensible to the sufferings of the negro women, and
totally regardless of promoting their happiness, or of studying to
ameliorate their hard lot; and that the instances are by no means
uncommon, in which they treat and have them punished with the utmost
severity: that they can raise, to no gentle tone, their soft voices,
and exert, with no little energy, their spiritless frames, when
provoked by the awkwardness, or jealous of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>the
influence of their sable captives. Ah! much to be lamented is that
state of oppression on the one part, and debasement on the other, which
can convert the expression of that distinguishing feature of beauty, of
female beauty more especially, from that which indicates right feeling,
to that which betrays a superiority the God of nature designed not. A
woman&rsquo;s eye should melt with tenderness, sparkle with innocent
animation, weep with those that weep, and beam with the rays of joy at
the happiness of another.</p>
<p>Such <i>was</i> the expression which shed its consolation on the
desolated Imihie, upon the visit of her new mistress to her lowly hut.
This amiable woman was young, but her mind had been early matured in
the school of adversity: a hapless fate had fixed her residence in a
remote part of Jamaica, but she had also learnt, from precepts which
will never lead astray, &ldquo;in whatsoever situation she was,
therewith to be content.&rdquo; From the same Master who had inspired
this lesson of the apostle, she had also learnt the only cure for the
rebellion of the mind; that force defeated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>its
object; that it was the interest of those who possessed power over
their fellow-beings, that they should be attached to life, for nothing
could be expected from them, the moment that they no longer feared
death. Guiding her conduct by this principle of enlightened reason,
derived from a far higher source, the most genuine sentiments of
humanity were in constant exercise, by a corresponding course of
action. She could not, indeed, as an obscure and solitary individual,
break or remove the yoke which oppressed her fellow-creatures; but she
could render it easier to be borne, and could, sometimes, even for a
time, dissipate the cruel sense of it, by promoting and favouring the
natural tastes of her poor slaves. Their lodging, clothing, and food,
were all attended to by persons she could depend upon, and regularly
inspected by herself. Far from regarding the occupation degrading, she
persevered in it as a commanding duty; and she reaped her high reward,
by the grateful affection of her poor servants. By various simple
methods, she roused from the apathy of despair, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>and
awakened the sensibilities. Little festivals conducted with judgment,
innocent recreations, and simple rewards, preserved her slaves from the
continual melancholy, which had too just a foundation. She sympathized
with mothers, and delighted to share with them the caresses of the
children.</p>
<p>Her husband, although possessing not her intelligence and elevation
of mind, nor actuated by the principle that directed the energies of
his amiable wife, yet was induced, by her unostentatious usefulness,
and evident success in her plans, to accede to most of the humane
innovations she proposed to him; convinced, by her arguments, that it
would be his interest to be humane. Hence, their plantation exhibited a
picture of comfort seldom seen, and their slaves had every appearance
of health. They were allowed wholesome provision in ample quantity,
with as much fruit as they wished; they had the liberty of keeping
poultry, and to cultivate a piece of ground with esculent roots; their
huts were comfortable, and when sick they experienced the kindest
attention; and they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102"
name="pb102">102</a>]</span>were frequently suffered to associate with
each other in little parties, for recreation and amusement.</p>
<p>Such were the proprietors of the poor Imihie and her hapless boy,
who soon began to find the benefit of kind treatment; and it is
probable, had Providence ordained that it should have been enjoyed,
immediately after landing on a foreign shore, that the miseries of the
voyage, and even the horrors of bondage, might have been overcome by
youth, and that wonderful buoyancy of the human mind, that seems to
force itself above the swelling waves of misfortune. But the arrow had
sunk too deep: its barb had been too powerfully poisoned, for human
effort to withdraw, or to antidote it. Imihie was evidently the victim
of that disease which hurries to an untimely grave, so many individuals
of her hapless country; and which, throughout the world, may be termed,
although not yet classed, a broken heart. The first symptom of this
disorder among negroes, became evident; namely, the black and glossy
skin assumed an olive hue, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103"
href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>tongue became white, and the
poor sufferer became overpowered by such a desire to sleep, that it was
found impossible to resist it, a deadly faintness preventing the
smallest exercise. In fact, a languor and general relaxation of the
whole wonderful machinery of the human frame, seems to threaten death
day by day, yet the sufferer still survives. So great is the state of
despondency accompanying this distressing malady, that those afflicted
will suffer themselves to be beaten, rather than attempt to move or
walk. Happy was it for Imihie that she had not a task-master&rsquo;s
whip to dread; and that the loathing which she had for mild and
wholesome food, was not attributed to obstinacy, but to what it really
was, a symptom of the disease which was insiduously undermining the
vital principles of life. It made rapid advances upon her delicate and
youthful frame: her respiration became laborious and painful, the
extremities became swollen, and suffocation seemed frequently to impede
the action of the heart. In this state she languished and suffered
several months; but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104"
name="pb104">104</a>]</span>Imihie had her consolations, under an
infliction, the natural consequence of melancholy upon the organs of
the human frame.</p>
<p>We have said, that the humanity and enlightened reason of the
excellent Mrs. Delany, were derived from a high source; even from that
source which exalts feeling to a principle: the one is frequently as
transient as the excitement, the other is founded upon a firm basis;
offering a permanent and pure incentive to action, by adding a value to
existence, as connecting it with a future. Such is one of the many
blessed fruits of a Christian faith. Mrs. Delany felt its commanding
power: she was a Christian in <i>deed</i>. Hers was not a speculative
creed, but a practical code: it was her daily, hourly study to act
upon.</p>
<p>It is true, Jamaica, at the period of our narrative, enjoyed not the
high privileges it now possesses of Christian instruction, and of
Christian example; but Mrs. Delaney was one amongst the few, who,
feeling and enjoying the light and the consolation of religion, were
anxious to impart a portion of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105"
href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>what cheered their own
hearts&mdash;of that which directed their steps, to those who yet
&ldquo;sat in darkness and the shadow of death.&rdquo; Deeply
interested in her hapless slave, from the moment she saw her, Mrs.
Delaney had soothed, by truly maternal attention, her bodily
sufferings, and her mental anguish. She inwardly deplored her total
ignorance of that grand source of consolation, the knowledge of which
was so open to those who despised it. She gently prepared the feelings
and the understanding for the reception of that light, which she
fervently prayed might be imparted to her benighted mind. She gradually
led her docile steps, her mental view, to Him who invites the heavy
laden to resort to him for rest; to seek Him who is the strength and
the fortress of those that trust in him; to adore, with unfeigned
humility, that transcendent mercy, which became poor that we might be
rich. What heart is there, bereft of all earthly good, all earthly
hope, but must expand with joy, to receive into its most inmost
recesses the precious promises of Christianity?&mdash;of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>that
mild and beneficent religion, which so tenderly sympathizes with every
emotion of the weak, the frail, the lacerated bosom? Was it then
surprising, that the poor Imihie, with feelings too powerful for
utterance, hung upon the mild accents of Mrs. Delaney, as she described
to her the sufferings of the Redeemer&mdash;the abyss of wretchedness
from which he rescued mankind&mdash;the dreadful penalty from which he
saved a rebellious world? Was it surprising, that, with an eager
gratitude, which gave a heavenly expression to her languid eyes, and
displayed itself in every varying feature, she listened to the glorious
truths of revelation, unfolded in terms suited to her expanding
capacity; and that, with all the simplicity of unsophisticated nature,
receiving the noblest impressions of Deity, she bade Mrs. Delaney thank
her great good God for his marvellous kindness to wretched captives,
and for the unsearchable riches of his grace. Never was she wearied in
hearing her kind instructress recount the sufferings of the incarnate
God: tears, the offspring of genuine feeling, chased each <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>other down her altered countenance, as Mrs.
Delaney directed her imagination to the garden of Gethsemane, to the
judgment-hall, where He, whose throne is heaven, and his footstool
earth, was exposed to insult, contumely, and scorn; scourged, buffeted,
spit upon; betrayed by one friend, denied by another, and abandoned by
all; subjected to a painful, a cruel, and an ignominious death, in the
presence of insulting foes: the very spirit clouded by the momentary
abandonment of heavenly aid, forcing from the lips of the sufferer the
agonizing exclamation: &ldquo;My God, my God! why hast thou forsaken
me?&rdquo; and all this for the love he bore for those who became his
murderers.</p>
<p>Thus would Mrs. Delaney, in language suited to the capacity of her
pupil, recount the affecting history of our Redeemer, and gradually
open her mind (aided by the Spirit of grace constantly implored to
direct her) to the grand truths of the gospel. The soul of the dying
Imihie imbibed the soothing balm, felt the powerful energy, and gladly
received the consolation the religion of Jesus <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>alone has power to give. Her tears, it is true,
still flowed for Africa, and for Tumi&aacute;h; but they were no longer
bitter tears. The heavenly ray which had been communicated to her soul,
had not only enlightened it, but stilled <span class="corr" id=
"xd20e1172" title="Source: it">its</span> perturbations; and captivity
was deprived of its horrors, in the enjoyment of those lively
instructions in the way of holiness and peace, so impressively imparted
by her truly Christian mistress.</p>
<p>Often when administering some relief to her bodily suffering, Mrs.
Delaney would ask her how she felt herself. She would say, with a
serene smile, &ldquo;weak, weak; but joy, joy here,&rdquo; laying her
hand on her bosom, then pressing that of her compassionate
benefactress. No murmur, no complaint, proceeded from her lips; but her
mind appeared ever tranquil, and her soul happy. Sometimes, indeed,
while caressing Samboe, the tear would swell in her eyes; but she had
learned the comprehensive prayer, &ldquo;Lord, let thy will be
done!&rdquo; and a frequent, affecting repetition of it, while she
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>pressed her boy to her bosom, spoke volumes to
the sympathizing Mrs. Delaney.</p>
<p>During this daily increase of spiritual strength, her frame
gradually sunk under the pressure of her disease, which resisted every
tried means of relief, and finally came to its usual termination;
<i>viz.</i> suffocation. Thus closed the mortal career of the youthful
Imihie, one of the many thousands of victims to a commerce, which, it
is feared, the mercenary will always cling to; in which desperate men
will ever be found to hazard; and, even in Africa, tyrants ever be
ready to supply the horrid market; (<a href="#note.q"><i>Note</i>
<span class="sc">Q</span></a>.) while few, it is to be feared, will,
like the poor Imihie, after a series of misery, find a Mrs. Delaney to
soothe their sorrows, and point to realms where all tears shall be
wiped away, and sorrow and sighing shall flee for ever.</p>

<p class="first">The infant Samboe, thus bereaved of his suffering
mother, was yet too young to feel the full magnitude of his loss; yet
his little heart experienced emotions he had no power to utter, when he
was told she would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111"
name="pb111">111</a>]</span>never more awake to his call, nor could
<i>he feel happy</i>, when, with expressions of joy, he saw the negroes
of the plantation remove his &ldquo;silent mother&rdquo; to the burial
ground, with every demonstration of joy. (<a href="#note.r"><i>Note</i>
<span class="sc">R</span></a>.)</p>
<p>An ever kind Providence has, however, made the griefs of children to
be transient; and Samboe, the favourite of Mrs. Delaney, from his
sweetness of disposition, great activity, and early intelligence, would
probably have presented a pleasing exception to the unhappy lot of his
enslaved countrymen&mdash;might justly have enjoyed the title of the
<i>happy negro</i>&mdash;had his benefactress been spared to bless the
sable dependants on her kindness. But life, at all times and in all
situations transient and uncertain, may be said to be peculiarly so in
the West Indies; the progress of disease being so rapid, and the
excitements to it so many. That dreadful visitation, the yellow fever,
broke out in the district of the Delaney plantation: numberless were
the victims to the &ldquo;pestilence that walketh in noon-day;&rdquo;
and among them were Mr. Delaney and his amiable wife. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>Those who were capable of appreciating their worth, who had felt
their benevolence, had enjoyed the privileges they allowed, and knew
how rarely they were found in the plantations, mourned them with
unfeigned sorrow, their loss closing up the avenues of consolation and
of hope; and those too young to feel how much they were deprived of,
were quickly made sensible of a change from a system of Christian love
and benevolence, to that built upon the mere hope of worldly gain. As
it is not the custom in the English colonies, as in the French, for the
negroes to be attached to the plantation, those of the Delaney estate
were, upon the sale of it, dispersed amongst different purchasers; and
the infant Samboe became the property of a cruel mercenary, who
employed the poor child to wait upon him, when indulging in all the
luxurious ease of an occidental despot. By those who have seen the
various caprices of a temper altogether uncontrouled, the whims of a
mind destitute of cultivation and obstinate in ignorance, the cruelty
of a disposition formed by the possession <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>of a precarious power
over helpless individuals; by those, and those only, will the various
species of suffering to which the innocent child was subjected be
understood; and the terrors which were produced by the horrid
imprecations, the unmanly abuse, and vulgar epithets of this brutal
master, upon the gentle and timid character of the poor little Samboe.
It was then he began to feel the loss, and to pine for the tenderness
of his mother and his benefactress; and there is little doubt but he
would have soon followed them to the tomb, had not an incident
occurred, that emancipated him from the tyrannical controul by which he
so acutely suffered. One day, while attending his master at breakfast,
just as he handed the coffee his foot slipped, and it was thrown over a
beautiful cimar, which the luxurious planter highly valued, as the gift
of a lady to whom he was partial. He rose in haste and in anger, and
aiming a blow at the now kneeling boy, missed the blow, and fell
himself to the ground, striking his head by the fall against the edge
of a sofa. Seeing him suddenly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114"
href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>fall, some attendants in
waiting rushed to his assistance, but in vain: the blow had been fatal,
he had fallen to rise no more on earth! Happy was it for Samboe that
there were witnesses, <i>white</i> witnesses of the scene, who could
exonerate him from all intentional connexion with, or wilful
provocation to the catastrophe. The alarm, however, of the unoffending
child was distressing: the countenance of the planter at all times bore
evidence of his ill-regulated mind and indurated heart, and the awful
hand of death fixed them in an expression the most horrid. With little
idea of such sudden death, the poor child thought he was but in a
violent passion, and, in the most piteous accents, clasping his hands
together, besought &ldquo;massa to forgive poor Samboe, who would not
break cup any more, would not spoil dress any more.&rdquo; But his
supplication was alike unheeded by master and attendants, except by
one, who kicking him as he passed, said: &ldquo;Get out of the way, ye
little whining dog, or I&rsquo;ll make ye.&rdquo; Samboe crept from the
apartment, and crouching under some furniture, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>felt
all the bitterness of a life of slavery, of which nature, in its first
fresh feelings, can be capable. Happily again for the infant captive,
the wife of the planter could not bear to retain in her service the
innocent cause of her husband&rsquo;s death; at least, secretly
rejoicing at her own emancipation from his arbitrary disposition, she
affected so to say: consequently, she expressed her wish of selling him
to the manager of a neighbouring plantation, but as her recent loss
rendered it impossible for her to have a personal interview, she thus
communicated her wish by note to this person: &ldquo;Unable to bear the
sight of the young author of the death of the best and tenderest of
husbands, Mrs. Williamson requests the favour of Mr. Martin to take
charge of, and dispose of him, in any way he may judge most conducive
to her interest, and to employ the proceeds in the purchase of a more
effective, that is, laborious slave. Mrs. W. relies on the known
kindness of Mr. M. to render this service to the disconsolate widow of
his late friend.&rdquo; My young readers will doubtless <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>be
shocked, that Mrs. Williamson should thus profess grief for the loss of
a man she married for his wealth, without either esteeming or loving
him; but it is no fancied picture, and is presented to show, that,
unless the heart is continually watched, and the mind sedulously
cultivated, in situations favourable to indolence and self-indulgence,
the moral feelings quickly become blunted, and the individual can
easily, and without any self-reproach, assume any sentiments and any
line of conduct which best suits the whim or caprice of the moment; and
she hated the little Samboe, because she once overheard him, in a
moment of unusual gaiety, telling a circle of slaves what merry dances
they had at Delaney, when dear Missy Delaney danced with poor Samboe.
Upon such trifles will envy condescend to feed its insatiate appetite.
Good, however, to Samboe, was educed from all this evil. Mr. Martin was
the respectable and humane manager of the Moreton estate; (see
&ldquo;<i>Twilight Hours Improved</i>,&rdquo; page 85;) subjected to
his superintendence during the minority <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>of Mr. Frederick
Moreton, by the will of his deceased father; and whose humane treatment
of his negroes had excited the displeasure of the young man&rsquo;s
guardian, Mr. Penryn, who firmly believed the African race created only
to become the slaves of Europeans. Mr. Martin lost no time in complying
with the request of his fair neighbour. He well remembered frequently
having seen the little Samboe in attendance upon his imperious master,
and never failed to admire his extreme docility, mildness, and
intelligence; and he looked upon the circumstance of Mrs.
Williamson&rsquo;s desire to sell him, as very fortunate, as he had,
only a few days previous, received the commission to send to England a
negro boy for his young master.</p>
<p>The purchase was soon made, and Samboe was once more under the roof
of an indulgent master. Every attention was given, in order to
establish his health, and improve his personal appearance, that he
might credit the choice of his purchaser, and please the young eye of
his future master. He only remained at Jamaica to effect these
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>purposes, when he was consigned to the care of
the captain of an English West Indiaman, with instructions to have him
safely conveyed to Mr. Penryn&rsquo;s, Portman Square.</p>
<p>Samboe evinced the greatest reluctance to go on board; he clung to
Mr. Martin, who himself conducted him, and trembled violently,
declaring he could not go into great ship, or on great wide sea. No one
could account for this extraordinary reluctance and evident terror; for
they knew not that the young heart of the little negro was throbbing
with recollections for which he had no name, and which he had no power
to express. It is true, they were vague, like the confused remembrance
of a troubled dream, but they were powerful; and it was with the utmost
difficulty Mr. Martin soothed him, by gentleness, promises, and
assurances; and, after all, was obliged to leave him, when he had cried
himself to sleep upon a coil of rope on the deck, no one being able to
prevail upon him to go below, and Mr. Martin positively forbidding
coercion.</p>
<p>The grief and terror of the poor boy were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>renewed, when he discovered he had been left by
Mr Martin; but a series of kind treatment, and many little indulgences
granted him, after a while reconciled him to his new situation; while
his simplicity and quickness greatly endeared him to the sailors, with
whom he became quite a pet. The voyage passed in this manner without
any particular occurrence; and Samboe was introduced, one evening, to
the dining room of Mr. Penryn, filled with elegant company.</p>
<p>Had he been one of the wonders of the world, he probably would not
have excited more attention, or elicited more remarks. The ladies
admired his eyes and his teeth; the gentlemen enquired if he was a
Molembo, or from the Kroo country, and began an animated debate on
slavery, and the slave-trade. Each lady gave her opinion of the most
becoming dress to contrast with the jet black of his skin. One asked
him if was not glad to come to England; another enquired if he was
sorry to leave Africa; a third enquired if they flogged him at the
plantation; while a fourth, by way of compliment <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>to
the lady of the house, observed, he was a happy black boy, to have such
a charming mistress. To all these remarks the poor child could give no
reply; nor, it would seem, was it expected; and, much to his joy, he
was dismissed to the care of the groom, until his apartment and
employment about the person of his young master could be arranged.</p>
<p>The groom, however, was highly indignant that a vile <i>neger</i>
boy should be committed to his care: &ldquo;Did they fancy he would let
a black get between his sheets? No, indeed; there was the hay-loft, the
stable-boy should pull him a truss of straw in the corner there: surely
that would be a better bed than most negers got. Sleep with me, indeed;
no, I&rsquo;d lose my place first, and tis&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a bad one,
neither<span class="corr" id="xd20e1300" title="Not in source">.</span>
Had they told me to take C&aelig;sar the house-dog, or Neptune the
Newfoundlander, I should not have so much have minded; but a neger boy!
surely my master was half-seas over to think of it.&rdquo; This, and
much more of the same refined objection, passed in the kitchen of
&mdash;&mdash; Penryn, esq. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href=
"#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>and, according to the
groom&rsquo;s kind arrangement, Samboe was indulged with some clean
straw in the stable-loft.</p>
<p>The children of oppression and calamity quickly sympathize; a
kindred feeling draws them together: thus it was with Samboe the
African, and Frank the English stable boy. An orphan from his cradle,
and a parish apprentice, Frank had been early subjected to every
oppression&mdash;exposed to every temptation; but a certain buoyancy of
spirit, and a persevering ardour of mind, enabled him to rise above the
one; and the latter was rendered less dangerous, by his constant,
unremitted love of employment. He was busily engaged mending his shoes,
when his master, the groom, introduced the young negro to his
acquaintance. &ldquo;There, Frank,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is a
companion for you, my lad; take care he don&rsquo;t touch the horses,
and mind he don&rsquo;t run away. Lock him up when you come in for your
supper: you may offer him some, but I don&rsquo;t know what negers eat,
I&rsquo;m sure. Master should have told us that, I think, for I
don&rsquo;t expect they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href=
"#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>live as we do. Eh! my lad, do ye
mind me?&rdquo; he added, with a raised voice, as he saw Frank take the
hand of the timid Samboe, and ask him if he was tired. &ldquo;Oh yes,
sir!&rdquo; he replied, touching his fur cap, &ldquo;I will be sure to
take care of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glad to get quit of the restraint which the charge imposed upon him,
the groom was in high good humour with Frank, and promised, if he would
attend to his orders, he would give him a shilling. Astonished at his
unwonted generosity, Frank repeated his assurances; and having made his
new companion understand that he desired to make him comfortable, with
the happy facility of children to be so when left to themselves, they
quickly became acquainted. Frank found that <i>negers</i> could eat
good bread and fresh meat; that they had no objection to tarts; and
that even a custard, given by the cook as a treat to merry Frank, was
equally relished by the neger boy. After this luxurious repast, during
which, if it was not the &ldquo;feast of reason and the flow of
soul,&rdquo; there was, most unquestionably, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>innate benevolence on one side, and genuine
gratitude on the other, the new-made friends sought repose on the same
clean truss of straw, and together enjoyed the refreshment of
&ldquo;nature&rsquo;s sweet restorer.&rdquo; Not long, however, after
they had thus lain down, Frank was roused from his yet imperfect
slumber, by a slight rustling and a low voice, very near him. He spoke
gently to his new bed-fellow, but received no reply. Frank had that
tincture of superstition which usually attaches to the ignorant and
uncultivated; and the unusual sound, his new situation, and the
profound darkness, aided the impression; while a thought of the little
negro became associated with the recollection of several marvellous
ghost-stories he had heard. He ventured, however, (not without
considerable reluctance,) to feel if his sable companion was by his
side, and discovered, to his amazement, that he was not there. The
murmur still continued, and Frank, trembling all over him, made a
desperate effort, and called lustily, &ldquo;Samboe, Samboe!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Samboe here,&rdquo; replied the boy, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>in a
soft and gentle tone; &ldquo;Samboe here, but wicked boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank&rsquo;s courage returned at the sound of Samboe&rsquo;s voice
clearly pronouncing these words, although he was at a loss to account
for his self-accusation. &ldquo;Why, what have you done to be wicked;
where are you?&rdquo; he enquired. Samboe&rsquo;s imperfect knowledge
of the English language, permitted him not to understand the full
import of these questions; and it was not until Frank, with renewed
courage at finding his companion was really a mortal, contrived to make
him understand his repeated enquiry, why he had risen, and why he
called himself wicked? &ldquo;Because Samboe forgot lesson dear Missy
Delaney teach him. Pray to great God before sleep; pray to great God
when eyes open; pray to good God give food; pray to good God give
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank now understood, that Samboe, in the novelty of his situation,
and probably from the effects of a little porter he had taken, had
forgotten to offer his simple tribute of thanks and respect to the
omnipotent Creator, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125"
name="pb125">125</a>]</span>which the good Mrs. Delaney had taught him
habitually to do; although he was too young when she died, to admit any
further religious instruction, or to understand more than that a great
God, beyond the blue sky, observed all his actions.</p>
<p>Samboe had never, until this night, neglected this lesson; but, with
uplifted hands and bended knee, was accustomed to acknowledge the
protection and the support of the Being he had been taught to regard,
as ever beholding, and with unwearied care protecting, all men. Sleep,
however, had not closed his eyes, ere the omission was recollected, and
he had crept out of the straw, to offer his simple orison, the low
murmur of which had so much alarmed his new friend. Having concluded,
he returned to his straw couch, and slept the sleep of innocence,
untill awaked by Frank rising to his morning duty in the stables.</p>
<p>Frank possessed an intelligence of mind, as well as activity of
spirit, which required but opportunities to develope themselves. The
incident of Samboe&rsquo;s forgotten prayer, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>impressed his youthful mind. How was it he had
never been taught to pray? He had never seen it practised among those
he had been with. He thought people went to church to pray; yet surely
if a black boy thought it right to pray, a white boy ought. Perhaps it
was a custom among them? Yet, such was the innate impression he had,
that it was right and proper, that he felt a species of shame to answer
Samboe in the negative, when he artlessly enquired if he did not pray
to great God, to take care of him; he, too, who knew so many things:
for, to Samboe, Frank seemed a miracle of cleverness, when he described
his various employments, and displayed, to his astonished visitor, the
results of his ingenuity, which he did with no little
self-complacency.</p>
<p>Samboe seemed now the happiest of human beings. He suffered nothing
to pass unnoticed; asking the reason, the use, the name of every thing
he heard, or saw, or touched. This he contrived to do, either by broken
words, gestures, or signs. The new-made friends thus passed several
hours <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>of the morning, before the groom made his
appearance; for, although his apartments were above the stables, he did
not often occupy them, finding numerous engagements more pleasant than
attending to his duty.</p>
<p>The only unpleasant circumstance of this morning of delight to
Samboe, was its chilliness. It was one of those which frequently occur
in May, as if to reprove the hastiness of the family of Flora, in
putting forth their fair forms; and its asperity was severely felt by
the little African. Frank determined to make him as comfortable as he
could; and having received no orders to the contrary, lighted a fire in
the groom&rsquo;s room, and invited Samboe to its genial warmth, while
he quickly prepared a comfortable mess of milk-pottage.</p>
<p>They were thus enjoying themselves, when the <i>master of the
house</i> appeared, half awake, and storming at Frank for a lazy dog,
for not having swept the stable-door. But he supposed he and the
beggarly neger had been idling away their time together. Frank, who was
used to his arbitrary temper, said <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128"
href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>little; but, making signs for
Samboe to return to the loft, he quickly prepared every thing for his
master&rsquo;s toilet, and proceeded to rectify the omission of not
having swept the door-way. While thus engaged, a servant from the house
arrived with an order to the groom to take the negro-boy to a
clothes-shop, and have him neatly clothed, until a a proper dress could
be fixed upon; as he was to have an interview with his mistress and
young master, who neither of them could bear the smell of tar, exhaling
from the filthy things he wore.</p>
<p>This message, delivered in due form to the groom while he was
shaving himself, nearly endangered his cutting his throat, by the
resentful agitation it caused, that he should be appointed to wait upon
a <i>neger</i>. It was a degradation which he could not, nor would not
submit to. Following, therefore, the example of his superiors, he
delegated the office to his subordinate; and calling loudly for Frank,
as soon as the messenger had left him, he desired him to take the black
he seemed so fond of, to Mr. Draper&rsquo;s, and get <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>him
rigged. &ldquo;And mind ye, Frank, boy, call at the &rsquo;potecaries
or &rsquo;fumers, and bid &rsquo;em pour some musk or lavender, or
something sweet over the lad, for missis is very particular; and as to
Master Fred, I shall have him trying how my legs will bear the exercise
of his new hunting-whip, if I do not please him about this black, who,
I dare say, will not be long before he feels it. But I suppose he has
been used to flogging, so it will be nothing to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank, highly pleased with this important commission, called the
shivering boy from the hay-chamber, and in no long time he was
completely equipped, in a suit according to the taste of Frank and the
vender: certainly as stiff and ill made as it well could be; while the
effusion of lavender-water was completely accomplished, even till the
poor boy&rsquo;s eyes became filled with tears, from the potency of the
perfume, and every person he passed on his return, half stopped, at
meeting with the unusual odour.</p>
<p>Samboe, however, had yet some hours to become reconciled to his new
habiliment; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>and his friend Frank had so many modes and
sources of employment and amusement, that those hours passed insensibly
away. At length, about four o&rsquo;clock, the groom again appeared to
conduct him to the house; and when arrived, a footman desired him to
follow him to the apartment of his lady, previously to her taking her
morning airing.</p>

<p class="first">From the reciprocation of the heart&rsquo;s best
affections, which had marked the short period of Samboe&rsquo;s
acquaintance with Frank, we may now follow the young stranger to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>inanity of an Anglo West Indian boudoir; in
which were Mrs. Penryn, reclined on a <i>chaise longue</i>, a young
lady spangling some delicate muslin, and Mr. Frederick Moreton standing
at a distant part of the room. The footman having opened the door,
pointed to Samboe to enter, and immediately closed it upon him, leaving
the timid boy to the scrutinizing looks of Mrs. Penryn, the oblique
attention of the young lady, and the supercilious glance of the boy,
who was engaged in the <i>humane</i> employment of holding a live mouse
by the tail, as high as his arm could reach; while a kitten, eagerly
attending to its writhings, kept springing, instinctively, to catch it,
and as often, from the violence of the exertion, fell back on the
floor. Had it not been for the chill which pervaded his frame, in his
way to this apartment, Samboe might have thought himself in the West
Indies, both as to the temperature, and the luxurious ease displayed in
the arrangement of it. An elegant Persian carpet, entirely covered it;
sofas, ottomans, and couches, invited to indolence and repose;
ornaments of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>the richest and most expensive materials, vases,
cabinets, &amp;c. adorned it; and a number of tropical birds, of
beauteous plumage, displayed their captive state in superb cages of
various elegant forms; while shells of great magnitude and exquisite
beauty were displayed in different parts of this superb room, with
considerable judgment and taste; and a rich glow seemed communicated to
every object, from the light passing the draperies of beautiful
rose-coloured taffety curtains. Plants of the loveliest bloom and most
exquisite odour, completed the fascinations of this luxurious
apartment, tastefully arranged in beautiful baskets and vases,
reflected by the superb mirrors, of which there were several on each
side of the room.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penryn, half raising her pale and spiritless form from the sofa
on which she was reclining, was the first to break the silence which
followed Samboe&rsquo;s introduction. &ldquo;Come, Fred, do give Frolic
the mouse, and look at this boy. He will serve to amuse you, I hope;
for I think the dogs, the cats, the mice, and the flies, have had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>enough of you. Come, did you ever behold such an
uncouth creature as George has made him: why the boy looks as if he
were in a wooden case. He must not appear about you, till he has
something fit to put on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This feeling harangue did not divert the young gentleman from his
amusement for some minutes, till at length, more it would seem from his
own fatigue, than from any motive of compassion for the poor animals,
he gave the cat its natural prey; and it retired <i>swearing</i>, as
its murmur of triumph is styled, to enjoy the feast, under a sofa at
the further part of the room. &ldquo;Now, Lavinia,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Penryn, addressing the young lady, &ldquo;give us your opinion, my
dear; your taste is so good: what dress shall we have for Fred&rsquo;s
page? He will like whatever you decide upon, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, do you think so?&rdquo; replied Miss Lavinia, in the
most affected tone: &ldquo;Mr. Frederick seldom asks my opinion, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is but a boy, and you will excuse <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>him,
I&rsquo;m sure; but really this dress must be left to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Lavinia, &ldquo;he must have
<i>something</i> different from that he now wears, which is only fit
for the stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a very good place too, I think,&rdquo; remarked the
polite young gentleman, as he threw himself at his length on a sofa,
rousing by the action a little white terrier, which had been reposing
quietly upon it. The dog uttered a cry, and jumped on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Erminet cannot be quiet even here,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Penryn, angrily: &ldquo;I wish, Fred, you would look before you lie
down: I dare say you have lamed my pretty Erminet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say I have done no such thing,&rdquo; retorted the
respectful nephew: &ldquo;But I have no desire to stay, I assure you. I
am sure, though Lavinia talks of the stable, I had rather be there,
than shut up in this hot room. So make haste and determine about the
boy&rsquo;s dress, for I cannot stay shilly-shally here all
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder when you will learn to be civil,&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>said
Mrs. Penryn: &ldquo;I think, if you had had a few lessons of politeness
interspersed with Greek and Latin, it would have made you more
agreeable.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is all you women know of the matter. But
let me have no preaching. Have you done with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Fred, how provoking you are: did you not bid me send for
the boy? And now he is come, you want to go without settling any thing
about him. Remember, he is your property, and you must do what you
please about him. I shall trouble myself no more about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then leave it alone,&rdquo; said the young
barbarian; and striding past the trembling Samboe, he quitted the room,
shutting the door with violence after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity it is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penryn, after a short
pause, &ldquo;that Frederick is so hasty: such a good-hearted lad as he
is. I wish, Lavinia, you would undertake to soften down his manners: he
is really worth your trouble, my dear girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lady simpered, half blushed, expressed her doubt of having
any influence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>over Mr. Frederick, who was, indeed, a fine
manly boy. There was nothing she could refuse to dear Mrs. Penryn and
her guardian, and she would certainly endeavour to please Frederick,
that she might refine his manners a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, begin then, my dear girl, and fix upon a tasty dress
for the boy. I know Fred will be pleased when it is done. I intend
Samboe to be his constant attendant: he is to sleep in the little
anti-room, to be ever at hand to attend Frederick&rsquo;s pleasure;
and, in short, he is to do what he pleases respecting him. Mr. Penryn
says he will have hundreds under his power when he goes to
Jamaica.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reference to the taste of Lavinia, was the dictate of policy;
for she was recently become a ward of Mr. Penryn, was an orphan of
immense property, and only a few years older than Frederick. The
prudent Mr. and Mrs. Penryn were very desirous to favour an attachment
between them; and Mrs. Penryn was directed, by her husband, to seek
every opportunity of doing so. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137"
href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p>The young lady was of that negative character, so often met with
amongst those who, in large boarding-schools, lose every discriminating
trait in the general application of certain rules and certain pursuits.
Dress, admiration, and gaiety, alone had power to animate her pretty
features; from which, however, no intellectual ray ever beamed. She was
highly flattered by the desire of Mrs. Penryn to exercise her taste in
the choice of a dress for Samboe. That choice could not be difficult,
for one who had so frequently seen the variety of costume exhibited on
the stage; and as vanity, ostentation, and singularity, not congruity,
were to dictate the choice, it was soon fixed, as the young lady
thought, of that elegant form and expensive material, which could not
fail to please the young planter; and it must be owned, that when, a
few days subsequent, Samboe made his appearance in the elegant costume
of Persia, that he exhibited a very fair specimen of juvenile negro
beauty. The blue and silver vest and caftan, the full girdle, the
capacious trowsers, and the perfectly white <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>turban, with its golden cord and sparkling gems,
contrasted well with his sable skin and slender form; giving a
lightness to his air, which even the pressure of slavery was not able
materially to injure.</p>
<p>Lavinia&rsquo;s taste was loudly applauded; and even Frederick
condescended to say the boy looked something like what he ought to do.
But poor Samboe, like many a <i>white</i> boy and girl, felt the misery
of fine clothes, being continually reminded that he must not do this,
he must not lie there, lest he should soil his dress.</p>
<p>His young master would never suffer him out of his sight: not that
he cared a button for him or his clothes, but because he could not
allow of any cessation in tormenting a poor being over whom he had full
controul; and he was continually racking his invention, to devise some
new species of torment and teasing. With a mean species of jealousy, as
soon as he found Frank the stable-boy was the only kind being who
regarded the poor black boy as a fellow-creature, he interdicted Samboe
from ever going into the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href=
"#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>stable, or from speaking to his
good-tempered friend.</p>
<p>This was a cruel stroke to poor Samboe, thus to deprive him of the
only portion of comfort in his bitter draught of slavery. His mind was
in danger of becoming callous from oppression, and in proportion to the
degradation he was subjected to. He had no motive for action, but the
dread of punishment. Without voluntary agency, a mere passive
instrument in the hands of others, his mind would assuredly have become
irrecoverably contracted, and the powers of soul even destroyed, had
not the very tyranny and caprice which were producing these lamentable
results, transferred the suffering boy to the benevolent care of
Captain Tremayne, and his young nephew, Charles Roslyn. (See
&ldquo;<i>Twilight Hours improved</i>.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Become the property of the latter by the hasty gift of Frederick,
how different was the lot of Samboe, from a state of cruel coercion, of
degrading slavery, which was daily debasing every manly sentiment!

<p class="first">Samboe, placed with the respectable Mr. Llwellin, made
rapid progress in reading and writing, and in the elements of general
knowledge. His quickness gained the entire attention of his preceptor;
while these was a charm and freshness in all he said, which could only
be derived from quick perceptions and a warm heart&mdash;a buoyancy of
fancy and a fervid feeling, which won the affections of all those who
had to instruct him. With the deepest attention he would listen to Mr.
Llwellin, as in a simple and impressive manner he explained to him the
general principles of religion, the nature and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>duty
of worshipping God, the creation of man, his fall from virtue and
happiness, and the promised restoration through the merits of the
Redeemer. It is a mistake that these subjects are beyond the
comprehension, and excite no interest in the hearts of children.
Practical devotion and the Christian duties, have a forcible influence
on the ductile minds and unsophisticated hearts of the young. Hence the
transition of instruction is easy, and perfectly understood by them,
from the duty and privilege of prayer and praise, to the truth that we
are unable to do either, or even to think what is right, without
superior guidance and continual aid. The conviction of this at once
gives an object and a fervency to prayer; and he who prays fervently
and believing, however young he may be, will not be unheeded when thus
imploring the divine aid.</p>
<p>It was the invariable custom of Mr. Llwellin to assemble his family
in the evening. He then read a portion of the Holy Scriptures, and
explained them with admirable simplicity and pathos to his little
auditory. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>It was now that the prayers Samboe had said, as
it were mechanically, were now repeated with an earnestness which fully
indicated that they were not merely the offering of the lips; and so
much did he profit by the pious instructions, example, and care of Mr.
Llwellin, that he was admitted into the Christian church by baptism;
but, at the request of his young protector, retaining his former name
as his usual appellation although he received, at the font, that of
Henry.</p>
<p>So anxious was this interesting youth to attain all useful
knowledge, that he was always the first at his scholastic duties; and
when dismissed from them, after a little recreation, enjoyed with all
the zest of health and youth, he would occupy his time in religious
reading and study, drawing, and little mechanical works; equally
proving his strength of intellect and his active ingenuity. Though his
temper was frequently severely tried by the taunts and ridicule of the
boys, he never betrayed anger or resentment: he disarmed them by his
humility, patience, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href=
"#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>meekness; so that scoffers he
converted into friends. He was lively in his disposition, but taciturn
from thought, except when with his teachers; when he seemed to expand
every faculty of his mind to receive their instructions, while any
accession of knowledge caused his naturally brilliant eyes to beam with
added intelligence and delight.</p>
<p>With all these qualities of mind and heart, it is not surprising
that Samboe was a universal favourite; and unfeigned, indeed, was his
joy, when he was permitted to write to his dear massa Charles, whom he
never named without his eyes filling with tears of grateful affection.
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;my dear massa, I shall never
forget his goodness.&rdquo; Years passed on in this progressive
improvement, during which a regular correspondence was kept up between
Charles Roslyn and his proteg&eacute;, when an incident occurred which
opened a field for the exercise of those attainments it had been the
laudable and unremitted study of Samboe to acquire.</p>
<p>Colonel Roslyn was entertaining a party <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>of
gentlemen, among whom were admiral Herbert and his nephew Fitzhugh.
Charles Roslyn was the favourite midshipman of the admiral, and the
conversation turned upon the topic of the day; namely, the slave-trade,
and the probabilities of its abolition, as well as the capacity of the
negroes to profit by their freedom. Many were the arguments adduced for
and against; and Colonel Roslyn was naturally led to relate the
circumstances of Samboe&rsquo;s becoming Charles&rsquo;s
proteg&eacute;, and the high reward they had experienced in the sweet
disposition, high intellectual capacity, moral worth, and genuine
religious principles of the young negro. &ldquo;I have the sincerest
pleasure,&rdquo; observed Colonel Roslyn, &ldquo;in stating this
individual instance of the moral and intellectual worth of an African,
of which, doubtless, there are many similar instances, where
instruction and kindness have elicited and fostered the qualities of
the mind and heart. But we all remember the period, my friends, when
the African&rsquo;s claim to the character <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>and
privileges of man was even disputed&mdash;when they were considered as
somewhat of a superior species of ourang outang<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1511src" href="#xd20e1511" name="xd20e1511src">1</a>. This false
and inhuman estimate, succeeding years have disproved. It has been in
numberless instances shown that they are not only men, but capable of
becoming intelligent and virtuous men; and not only virtuous men, but
pious, unaffected, sincere Christians. I am not, however,&rdquo;
continued the colonel, &ldquo;an advocate for giving personal liberty
to numbers of men, unless, at the same time, I impart the principles of
religion and the arts of civil life. It is only by giving freedom to
the soul, and by encouraging the virtuous energies of man, that we can
make him capable of properly appreciating the blessing of liberty, and
preserve him from becoming a pest to society, instead of a useful
member of it. Without these correcting and restraining principles,
liberty would soon degenerate into licentiousness, and the possession
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>of power be exercised in deeds of
violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I entirely agree with you, colonel,&rdquo; observed the
admiral; &ldquo;and therefore be so good as to pledge me in a glass of
that excellent claret, when I offer my sentiment: &lsquo;Let the empire
of Britain be the empire of mercy; and let no shore re-echo with the
thunder of her power, but which shall also smile under the blessing of
her beneficence.&rsquo;&rdquo; This sentiment of the admiral&rsquo;s
was warmly received. During this conversation, a young man at the lower
end of the table appeared deeply interested in it. His animated and
penetrating countenance drew the attention of Colonel Roslyn, and he
expressed his pleasure, in observing to the admiral, that an interest
for the enslaved Africans seemed to animate his young relative; for it
was Fitzhugh, whose whole soul seemed engaged in the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; observed the admiral, &ldquo;Fitzhugh is
a very enthusiast in the cause, and I love him the better for it: it is
honourable to his feelings, and to those generous sentiments
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>which ought to pervade the heart, and direct the
conduct of a British officer. Have you not heard that he has obtained a
very responsible and active appointment in the new settlement of Sierra
Leone, and that, in a short time, he will sail for Africa? I doubt not
his conscientious attention to the duties devolving upon him, nor do I
think the directors could have made a more judicious choice; for, young
as he is, his firmness of principle, his rectitude in action, his
genuine feeling, and his cultivated mind, render him peculiarly
eligible to attend to the duties, and to surmount the difficulties of
an infant colony. He will form one of the council, which will be sent
from England, for the government of the colony. This council is
particularly instructed to secure to all negroes and people of colour,
equal rights, and equal treatment, in every respect, as the whites.
They are to be tried by jury, as the whites, and every facility given
to them to exercise their peculiar talents; employments being allotted
them according to their progressive capacity of discharging them. They
are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>especially, to be instructed in the principles
of religion and morals. Public worship and the reverent observation of
the sabbath, the general instruction of the adults and the judicious
education of the children, are the means to be used to draw this now
wretched race of men from the night of ignorance to the glorious light
of divine and temporal knowledge. In fact, the grand object of the
Sierra Leone Company is to substitute, for that disgraceful traffic
which has too long subsisted, a fair and legitimate commerce with
Africa, and all the blessings which may be expected from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, admiral, for this account,&rdquo; replied
Colonel Roslyn, &ldquo;and pray, with all my heart, that the benevolent
exertions of the Company may be crowned with final success; and I
believe I may assure you, that such is also the prayer of every
individual of the present company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fitzhugh,&rdquo; said the admiral, &ldquo;I have been telling
Colonel Roslyn that you are an enthusiast for the abolition of the
slave-trade<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>&mdash;that it is your dream by night, and your
stimulus by day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, my dear Sir, an ardent desire to use my individual
influence and exertions to remove from my country such a stain upon its
humanity; if as ardently to desire an amelioration of the wretched
state of the African; if to cherish and to bring into action all those
charities which distinguish reasoning man from instinctive brutes: if
to be all this constitutes an enthusiast, then do I, indeed, plead
guilty to the charge of enthusiasm. Nor am I likely to become less
so<span class="corr" id="xd20e1533" title="Source: ;">:</span> on the
contrary, the intelligence I have just received from my young friends
here, (directing his eyes to Alfred, and Charles Roslyn, who sat near
him,) has confirmed me in the assurance, that we have every thing to
hope from the judicious and liberal plan, of the Company to which I
have now the honour to be attached; and which has so highly flattered
me, by appointing me, in conjunction with others, to carry into effect
their beneficent purposes. But you know, my dear Sir, my deep
abhorrence of slavery <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href=
"#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>is derived from the practical
display of its cruelties; as well as from a deep reflection on its
moral turpitude, its impolicy, and its inconsistency with the boasted
honour and religious code of my country. Let those who question the
feasibility of the plan of civilization and emancipation, visit, as I
have done, the colonies, (more especially the Spanish colonies and the
Portuguese dominions in South America,) where the inhuman traffic of
slaves is carried to the greatest possible extent, forming the
immediate and private revenue of the crown; let them be but faintly
impressed with the horrors that constantly there occur, and I scruple
not to say, if they fail to enter their protest against a system so
barbarous, they deserve not the name of men, and make their religion
but an impious mockery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A myriad of instances might be adduced, to bear me out in my
assertions. The labour, of whatever nature it may be, or however
laborious, is performed by slaves, and seldom more than six negroes
appointed to remove the heaviest burdens. I have, for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>instance, seen at Rio de Janeiro, four only,
groaning under a pipe of wine, which they have had to remove through
the city. Many of these poor creatures are bred to trades, and are sent
out daily or weekly, with peremptory orders to bring home a certain
sum, at the expiration of the agreed time. What they can earn over,
they have to themselves; but they are always so highly rated, that it
is with the greatest difficulty they can raise the sum nominated; and,
in case of defalcation, it is attributed to indolence or laziness,
which subjects the unhappy victim to punishment. An awful instance of
the despair produced by cruelty and oppression, occurred during my
residence at Rio. A barbarous and remorseless wretch had a few slaves,
whom he used to send out upon the plan I have named, subjected to the
penalty of a severe flogging, if they did not, within a prescribed
time, earn the sum required and their food. One of these men was a
hair-dresser: he used to attend me very regularly, and always was
quiet, industrious, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153"
name="pb153">153</a>]</span>and even active, to promote his
master&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a little time, however, I observed him to be gloomy and
melancholy. I asked him the reason for the change, and was informed
that he had been unsuccessful, and could not render to his master the
sum required; and that he had little hopes of being able to raise it,
consequently was liable to punishment, I gave him something towards it,
but, being obliged to be absent a few weeks, knew not the result until
I returned; when I was informed, that, as the time approached when he
was to render his account, he became greatly distressed, and despaired
of accomplishing his engagement. He went, however, in great distress,
and tendered what he had gained; assuring his master he had used every
exertion to obtain the specific sum, and imploring from him a remission
of punishment, or a suspension, at least, for a few days. This was at
length granted him, but with horrid threats of many additional stripes
in case of failure. The time fast approached when he must return,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>and he was still deficient. He reached the door
of his master&rsquo;s house, when, in despair of being forgiven, and
dreading the ordeal he had to undergo, he took from his pocket a razor,
and, with a desperate violence, nearly severed his head from his body.
This horrid deed had no other effect upon his inhuman master, than to
increase his severity towards his other slaves, on whom he imposed
heavier burdens, to recompence him for the loss sustained by the death
of the miserable suicide<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1548src" href=
"#xd20e1548" name="xd20e1548src">2</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a usual practice,&rdquo; continued Fitzhugh,
&ldquo;when slaves become desperately ill, for their masters to disown
them, and turn them into the streets, to evade the expences of their
funeral; and, thus abandoned and exposed, their miserable existence is
soon terminated. I have to apologize for trespassing upon your
attention so long, gentlemen,&rdquo; observed this intelligent young
man; &ldquo;but I have only recounted one of a thousand instances which
have come under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155"
name="pb155">155</a>]</span>my own observation, of the barbarous abuses
of power exercised over the miserable captives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party expressed their obligation to Fitzhugh, for the relation
he had given them, and their united hope, that every effort made use
of, to ameliorate the situation of the already enslaved, and to check
the inhuman traffic for the future, might be crowned with success; all
agreeing, that every exertion that England makes to stop the bleeding
wounds of Africa, will cause her to rise in her national character more
resplendent, and must meet the approbation of every good, and what may
be justly called great men, at home and abroad, and, above all, the
approbation that of God who holds in his hands the destiny of
nations<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1557src" href="#xd20e1557" name=
"xd20e1557src">3</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I not heard you, Fitzhugh,&rdquo; enquired the admiral,
&ldquo;express a wish that you could meet in England with two or three
intelligent negroes, who would be willing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>to enter into
engagements with the Company, as instructors to the children, and whose
habits of civilization might give them an influence over their
countrymen without exciting any jealousies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have, dear Sir,&rdquo; replied Fitzhugh; &ldquo;and from
what I have learned of the mental and moral qualities of my young
friend&rsquo;s proteg&eacute;, I am anxious for their permission to
visit Aberystwith, in order to enquire if he has any objection to
accompany me to Africa. A few such young men as he is described to be,
would do more to effect our plans, than any other mode I can think of;
and as he has not yet made any choice of a profession, I should feel
myself most grateful to Colonel Roslyn and his friends, if they will
second and sanction my application to the youth, who owes so much to
their benevolent kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Roslyn said, &ldquo;Call upon us tomorrow morning, my dear
Sir, and myself and sons will be happy to co-operate, as far as in our
power, in your philanthropic exertions.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span></p>
<p>This being cheerfully accepted, the conversation took a general
turn, until the party broke up.</p>

<p class="first">Fitzhugh was punctual to his appointment at Colonel
Roslyn&rsquo;s; and after an interesting conversation, and the perusal
of a number of Samboe&rsquo;s letters to his protector Charles Roslyn,
it was agreed that Fitzhugh and Alfred Roslyn should proceed to Wales,
in order to ascertain the sentiments of Samboe <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>upon
his projected removal, respecting which, his own unbiassed choice was
to be consulted. The intended visit of the young men was to be
announced by letter to Captain Tremayne; and, as Fitzhugh possessed all
the ardour, promptitude, and zeal of a Clarkson, in the cause of
humanity, the letter was immediately written, and an early day fixed
for the journey. In the correspondence of Charles and his
proteg&eacute;, the interesting debates in the English senate,
respecting the slave-trade, frequently formed a part; and Samboe had
even so far expressed his sentiments upon the subject, that, when the
colony of Sierra Leone was first formed, he regretted that his youth,
and the mediocrity of his attainments, would oblige him to forego all
hope of being useful to his poor benighted countrymen; and he had very
sensibly felt disappointment at the ill success of the first
establishment: an ill success which sufficiently proved the truth of
the observation, that, &ldquo;if the restraints of slavery be removed,
without corresponding culture of the mind and heart, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>the
mere enjoyment of temporal benefits will not make the man either
grateful or happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Roslyn greatly regretted that the hourly-expected departure
of his ship, precluded him from the pleasure of accompanying his
brother and Fitzhugh to Aberystwith. Having taken leave of him, and
bearing his good wishes and tender remembrances to his kind relatives
and his affectionate Samboe, the travellers commenced their journey,
early in a lovely June morning, when every scene they passed,
manifested the riches and the bounty, the wisdom and beneficence of the
Creator. The meeting was what might be expected from refined feeling,
generous ardour, and virtuous exertion, on the one side; and grateful
respect, modest worth, and conscious ability, chastened by the most
engaging humility, on the other. Tears of unfeigned joy and gratitude
started into the eyes of Samboe, as he heard Mr. Llwellin assure
Fitzhugh, he had no hesitation in saying, that if Samboe acceded to his
proposal of accompanying him to Africa, he would be found a valuable
coadjutor in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160"
name="pb160">160</a>]</span>projected work of mercy: &ldquo;For he
is,&rdquo; continued the good old man, &ldquo;not only fully capable of
imparting the elements of general knowledge, but has a happy and
peculiar manner of instructing others in those divine truths by which
he regulates every action of his own life. Nor do I think you would
easily find a more fit instrument among us, for promoting the great
ends of civilization, and the moral and religious instruction of his
countrymen. I make no scruple in paying this just tribute to the
character and abilities of my dear pupil, in his presence, because he
well knows they are so much my genuine sentiments, that I have advised
his directing his attention to the instruction of others; and
Providence seems manifestly to favour the suggestion, by the present
offer enabling him to put it in practice. May his now benighted and
ill-fated countrymen become more and more sensible of the extensive
blessings preparing for them; and may my dear and docile pupil, Samboe,
be one of the favoured instruments of Heaven, (assisted by the Spirit
of grace,) to diffuse the light, to communicate the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>blessings of religion, and to lead the now
idolatrous African to rejoice in the high privilege of communion by
prayer and praise with the great Creator and compassionate Saviour; all
distinctions of colour and country being lost, in that generous
sympathy which should flow from the relation which all bear to that
Saviour who died for the redemption of all men<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1607src" href="#xd20e1607" name="xd20e1607src">1</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was such a heartfelt earnestness, such an affecting energy,
such genuine piety, in the voice and manner of the good Llwellin, while
he uttered his philanthropic wishes, that it made a forcible impression
upon his young auditors. Tears of respect, gratitude, affection, and
hope, filled the eyes of Samboe. The intenseness and contrariety of his
feelings became painful; and, unable longer to restrain their
expression, he threw himself at the feet of his venerable instructor,
and sobbed aloud, uttering broken sentences of obligation; and when a
little composed, earnestly praying that God, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>Almighty God, would enable him to assist in the
realization of all the generous plans of his future employers; and so
to act in every situation of life, as to do honour to the precepts of
his dear instructor, and to gladden his aged heart, with the knowledge
that those precepts had not been given in vain.</p>
<p>Encouraged to self-confidence by the unequivocal approbation of his
revered friend, Samboe hesitated not in his <span class="corr" id=
"xd20e1616" title="Source: determition">determination</span> of
accompanying Fitzhugh in his important mission; and a few days
subsequent to the interview we have related, was fixed for the
departure from a spot, endeared to the affectionate heart of the
African by many a tender tie, many an affecting remembrance. Parting
moments are painful to experience, and are so fraught with emotion,
that they admit not of correct description; it must, therefore, suffice
to say, that after a general adieu, and loaded with many a token of
affection and good will, cheered by many a blessing, and fortified with
many a prayer from those who loved him, Samboe quitted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>Aberystwith with Fitzhugh and Alfred Roslyn. The
intelligence, as well as simplicity of his remarks, upon the different
objects which engaged his attention during the journey, rendered it
peculiarly interesting to his companions. He was equally delighted with
the various objects of curiosity and interest which London presented,
and particularly with any thing which enlarged his views of any branch
of knowledge he had acquired, or which promised to assist him in his
future exertions to benefit his country. Fitzhugh found in him, a
companion who entered with ardour and untired zeal into every plan his
fertile benevolence devised, and determined to retain him under his own
immediate care and inspection. Every day increased his confidence in
the abilities and integrity of his companion; and every succeeding day
more strongly proved that they were built upon a basis, which ensured
their permanence and stability; even that of a rational, a deep, a
vital piety.</p>
<p>The period of sailing approached; and happy in the exercise of the
best feelings of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164"
name="pb164">164</a>]</span>humanity, and the highest energies of mind,
Samboe believed nothing could add to his felicity, when an incident
occurred which called forth all his gratitude to the Being who showered
his blessings upon him. He accompanied Fitzhugh to the house of a
gentleman who was ardent in the cause of the Africans, and who freely
lent the resources of an ample fortune to further every beneficent
plan, although habitual ill health precluded him from all active
exertions. On the arrival of the friends, this gentleman was just
mounting his horse for a morning airing. Seeing, however, Fitzhugh and
his companion advance, he ordered the groom to lead his horse back to
the stable, until his visitors left him, and he then entreated Fitzhugh
to enter. While this was passing, a mutual look of surprise and
recognition passed between Samboe and the groom, but nothing further:
the man leading the horse away, and Samboe following Fitzhugh into the
house.</p>
<p>After some conversation relative to the approaching voyage, Mr.
Courtney said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>&ldquo;Well, Fitzhugh, you have inspired many an
honest heart with the same glowing philanthropy which animates your
own; and, amongst the number, my excellent boy, Frank Wilson. He is
determined, if you will permit him, to accompany you to Africa.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Permit him, my good Sir? I shall be happy to have in my service,
a young man who does honour to his rank of life, and whose severely
tried principles have resisted many attacks: his ingenuity too, and
industrious habits, will make him essentially useful. But how can you
part from him, or how will Frank bear to be separated from his revered
benefactor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I believe we have not thought of ourselves,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Courtney, good humouredly: &ldquo;all is settled between
us, provided you did not object. Will you permit me to ring for
him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Most willingly,&rdquo; said Fitzhugh.</p>
<p>During this short conversation, the emotion of the grateful Samboe
was powerful. The features of the young man holding Mr.
Courtney&rsquo;s horse, were familiar to him: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>he
had marked the glance of recognition, and the name confirmed the vague
hope he had formed, that, in this young man, of whose character he had
just heard so high an eulogium, he had seen the first kind friend he
had known in England: he who had lightened his troubles, and cheered
his oppressed spirit; and this friend, this generous hearted youth, was
going to Africa, and was to be in the service of his valuable friend,
Fitzhugh; and they were all animated with the same spirit. How
delightful the thought! how transcendently kind the Almighty
Disposer!</p>
<p>While these thoughts were rapidly passing the mind of Samboe, Frank
Wilson appeared; and it would be hard to decide which of the party was
most gratified by the disclosure of the two friends, who in each
other&rsquo;s arms were not ashamed to weep.</p>
<p>Frank immediately entered upon his new duties; and every thing
having been benevolently and equitably settled by the directors to
ensure the comfort and advantage of the colony, the ships sailed for
their destination. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167"
name="pb167">167</a>]</span>It is not necessary to detail the
circumstances of the voyage, or to attempt to describe the emotions of
the young African, when he landed on his native shores.</p>
<p>Every individual possessing a manly mind and virtuous soul, is
patriotic: he rejoices in the weal, he mourns in the miseries of his
country. Samboe possessed a manly mind and a virtuous soul. He was a
patriot, and shrunk not from its high responsibilities. We detail not
his individual exertions; it will be sufficient to say, that he took an
ample share with his companions in the good work; that every thing had
been so judiciously arranged; that the conduct of the servants of the
Company was marked with such propriety, being sober, moral, and
exemplary, in the discharge of their respective duties; that the
efforts and zeal of the clergymen were attended with the happiest
effects; that, before the expiration of two years from the settlement
of the colony, order and industry exhibited their benign fruits in a
growing prosperity. The fame of the colony not only spread along the
whole western <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>coast, but penetrated into the remotest
interior: embassies were sent by far distant monarchs; and the native
chiefs, with a pleasing and entire confidence, sent their children to
the colony, to be instructed in reading, writing, and accounts, and to
be initiated in the Christian religion. In fact, there was every
reasonable ground for hope, that the joyful period was advancing, when,
by the blessing of Heaven upon the endeavours used, the continent of
Africa would be rescued from the darkness that obscured her, and would
exhibit the soul-cheering scene of light and knowledge, of civilization
and order, of peaceful industry and domestic comfort. But these
anticipations were destroyed by the treachery and faithlessness of a
government, which professed to hold the rights of man as sacred. We
shall give a cursory narrative of this event, as extracted from a
letter of Fitzhugh to his friends in England. (<a href=
"#note.s"><i>Note</i> <span class="sc">S</span></a>.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have distressing news to communicate, but we do not
despond. The French have appeared with an armed force before our
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>neat and rising town, upon which they have
pointed their guns. It was not until they had done this that we
perceived they were enemies; for they had English-built vessels, rigged
in the English mode, displayed the English flag, and had all the
sailors, which appeared on deck, dressed like English sailors. Thus
treacherously did they approach our peaceful colony. Conscious we had
no strength to resist, the governor directed a flag of truce to be
hoisted. Yet, after this order was executed, the French continued to
fire on the town, doing much damage, and killing several persons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrified at the suddenness of the attack, and conscious they
possessed no power of resistance, the alarmed inhabitants fled to the
woods, with such of their property as the confusion and limited time
would allow. When the enemy landed, therefore, they found the town
almost destitute of inhabitants, but rich in stores and clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plunder was the order of the day; and what they did not want,
they destroyed, burnt, or threw into the river. They also <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>killed all the cattle and animals, not sparing
even the dogs or cats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During a week this work of devastation continued; and when
they found nothing more to plunder, they set fire to the public
buildings, and all the houses belonging to the Europeans; entirely
ruining the beautiful and prospering colony, and leaving the colonists
in the most deplorable state of destitution; without provisions,
medicines, clothing, houses, or furniture. Sickness soon followed these
privations, and many have died for want of proper food, and exposure in
the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you read the above hurried account of our misfortune,
you will scarcely believe that these wanton cruelties have been
perpetrated by individuals of a nation, whose Convention boasted of
spreading &lsquo;light and liberty through the world.&rsquo; Alas! that
light is the blaze of anarchy, that liberty the most daring and gross
licentiousness!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sierra Leone colony was established for the godlike purpose
of abolishing the slave-trade; to enlighten the Africans; to render
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>them virtuous, rational, free, and happy; and
yet these powerful advocates and patrons of the rights of man, could
wantonly destroy, in its healthful infancy, a settlement in which those
rights were peculiarly studied and held sacred. &lsquo;By their fruits
ye shall know them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will yet, like the phoenix, arise from its ashes. It
was formed to promote the cause of justice, mercy, and religion; a
cause which possesses, in itself, the principle of
re-animation&mdash;an ever-renewing means of rallying its resources,
overborne, for a time, by a base treachery and unmanly violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My faithful Samboe, and no less faithful Frank, have been
like ministering angels to the distressed, in this season of calamity.
&lsquo;My poor country,&rsquo; said Samboe, &lsquo;and my generous
friends, <a id="xd20e1675" name="xd20e1675"></a>what a sad reverse is
here! But though grieved,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;I am not in despair;
for has not the Almighty said, (He in whom is no variableness nor
shadow of turning,) &lsquo;I will never leave nor forsake those who
trust in me. Commit thy way unto the Lord, and he shall bring it to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>pass.&rsquo; I cannot conclude my letter better,
than by assuring my dear &mdash;&mdash;, that such is the trust and
confidence we all repose in the Being, who out of evil still educes
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, to resume and conclude our narrative, we have but to say we may
speak of these difficulties in the past tense; they no longer, praised
be the great Disposer of Events, they no longer are experienced at
Sierra Leone; but have vanished, gradually, before the enlightened
policy of the superintendants, and the mild influence of Christian
doctrine. The enjoyments of the present life, the bright hopes of a
future state, are now communicated to thousands of our
fellow-creatures, formerly in a state of mental and moral darkness, and
obnoxious to the most frightful miseries, victims of the basest
passions, subjects of the most alarming fears.</p>
<p>Justice, mercy, and courageous perseverance, are now reaping their
high temporal reward; and the blessing of the Almighty upon patient
continuance in well-doing, enables England to boast that she has
overcome <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>the most inveterate prejudices, the most
firmly-established interests, built upon the basest passions; and this
by the simple power of experiment, and the eloquence of truth.</p>
<p>Sierra Leone, where this experiment has been made, now presents
itself as a medium of civilization for Africa. &ldquo;And in this point
of view, (it has been most justly observed,) is worth all the treasure
that has been expended upon it; for the slave-trade, which was the
great obstacle to this civilization, being now happily abolished by the
universal voice of England, there is now a populous metropolis, from
which may issue the seeds of reformation to this injured continent, and
which, when sown, may now, watered by the genial dews of heaven, be
expected to grow into fruit, without check or blight. New schools may
be transplanted from thence into the interior; teachers and travellers
be sent from thence in various directions; the natives resort in safety
to it from distant parts, mark the improvements, witness the comforts,
taste the enjoyments, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href=
"#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>and feel the protection of it.
Hence will mistrust give way to confidence, emulation will be raised,
imitation be encouraged, a desire of instruction be excited, and the
predatory ignorant savage be gradually moulded into the useful citizen
and the rational man.</p>
<p>Let then each English heart rejoice, that the moral stain, so long
apparent on our statutes, so long exhibited in our national character,
is now erased from the one, and expunged from the other; that the
impious doctrine so long contended for, that the law of force was
justifiable under certain circumstances, is now banished from the
deliberations of our senate; and man, whatever his country, whatever
his colour, is restored to his moral rights. Let us rejoice that we
have not only been the advocates of the oppressed&mdash;have triumphed
by perseverance and constancy over the oppressor; but that England has
become the favoured and glorious instrument of a God of mercy, to make
his light to shine upon those who sat in darkness and the shadow of
death. May every nation, feeling the blessing of that light,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>which is upheld by that mercy, follow the
example of our favoured isle! May the rich stream of mercy flow, and
diffuse throughout far-distant lands its fertilizing influences! May
the spirit of a Wilberforce and a Clarkson, inspire the breasts of the
powerful; and may the gratitude and the intelligence of Samboe, glow in
the heart, and animate the conduct of every <span class=

<p class="first">The arrival of a slave-ship in any of the rivers, is
the signal of civil war and disorder; the hamlets are burned, and the
miserable survivors are carried off, and sold to the slave-factors.</p>
<p>In the countries contiguous to Senegal, when slave-ships arrive,
armed parties are sent out to scour the country, and bring in captives
to the factors. The wretched beings are to be found in the morning,
bound back to back in the huts; whence they are conveyed, tied hand and
foot, to the slave-ships. These ships set sail in the night, that the
wretched captives may not know the moment when they quit for ever their
native shore, and all the tender ties that endear it.</p>

<p class="first"><i>Coosh-coosh</i> is corn beaten in a wooden mortar,
and sifted to a coarse flour; it is then put in an earthen pot pierced
like a colander, which is luted to the top of an earthen pot, in which
is boiling water, and sometimes broth, exactly as our steamers are. The
rising steam cures and hardens the flour; and when it is done
sufficiently, the broth and cooked flour are mixed, and considered a
delicious dish.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Slave-factories are established in almost every native
village. The kings of Dahomy and Whid&aacute;h are the most noted for
the infamous trade in slaves. It is usual when the slave-ships lie in
the rivers, for a number of canoes to go up the inland: these go in a
fleet, with thirty or forty armed natives in each. Every canoe is also
furnished with a four or six pounder fastened to her bow. Thus equipped
they depart, and are usually absent from eight to fourteen days. It is
said they go to fairs held on the banks of the rivers, and at which
there is a regular show of slaves. On their return, they generally
bring down from eight hundred to a thousand of these captives, for the
ships. They lie at the bottom of the canoes, their arms and legs having
been bound with ropes of the country. It has been disclosed, by
undoubted evidence, that the crews of these canoes go up the rivers
till they arrive to a certain distance of a village; they then conceal
themselves under the bushes which hang over the water, until the shades
of night, when they enter the village and seize the wretched
inhabitants, men, women, and children, who have no time to escape.</p>
<p>Nearly three hundred years have the European nations traded with
Africa in human flesh, and encouraged in the negro countries, wars,
rapine, desolation, and murder. The annual exportation of slaves from
this quarter of the globe, has exceeded one hundred thousand; numbers
of whom are driven down like sheep, perhaps a thousand miles from the
coast, and are generally inhabitants of villages that have been
surrounded in the night by armed force, and carried off bound in
chains, and sold into perpetual bondage.</p>
<p>A slave-merchant thus wrote to his factor: &ldquo;You will observe
to make a present of five gallons of rum to the Suma, with the usual
compliments on the Company&rsquo;s behalf; and to assure him, and other
useful persons near you, of the Company&rsquo;s intentions to give very
great encouragement to trade in those parts, more especially for
slaves, dry goods, elephants&rsquo; teeth, wax, cotton, &amp;c. and the
Company desire me to inform you, that they have settled your commission
at five shillings a head, for every merchantable slave, and so in
proportion for other articles, in the hope it will encourage you to
dispose of their goods to the best advantage.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">The following list of African articles, as exhibited
to Mr. Pitt and the House of Lords, by Mr. Clarkson, will illustrate
the ingenuity of the Africans, and the possibility of making its
natural productions a branch of lucrative and legitimate commerce.
These articles were contained in a box, formed of four divisions; the
first of which was filled with specimens of woods, polished; amongst
them, mahogany of five different sorts, tulip and satin-wood, cam and
bar-wood, fustic, black and yellow ebony, palm-tree, mangrove,
calabash, and date; and also seven species retaining their native
names, <i>viz.</i> tumiah, sarnaim, and jimlali&eacute;, each of a
beautiful yellow; acajou, a deep crimson; bask and quell&eacute; for
cabinet work; and bentin, the wood of which is used for the native
canoes. Various other woods, one of which was a fine purple; and from
two others a strong yellow and deep orange, and also a flesh-colour,
could be extracted. The second division included ivory; and four
species of pepper, the long, the black, the Cayenne, and the
Malaguetta: three species of gum, Senegal, copal, and ruber astringes;
cinnamon, rice, tobacco, indigo, white and Nankin cotton, Guinea-corn,
and millet<span class="corr" id="xd20e1745" title="Source: :">;</span>
three species of beans, of which two were for food, and the other
yielding an orange dye: two species of tamarinds, one for food, the
other to give whiteness to the teeth: pulse, seeds, and fruits of
various sorts; some of the latter of which, Dr. Sparrman had
pronounced, from a trial made during his residence in Africa, to be
peculiarly valuable as drugs.</p>
<p>The third division contained an African loom, with a spindle and
spun cotton round it; cloths of cotton of various kinds, made by the
natives, some white, others dyed, and others, in which they had
interwoven European silk; cloths and bags of grass, fancifully
coloured; ornaments of the same material; ropes made from a species of
aloes, and others, remarkably strong, from grass and straw; fine string
made of the fibres of the roots of trees: soap of two kinds, one of
which was formed from an earthy substance: pipe bowls made of a clay of
a brown red, one beautifully ornamented with black devices, burnt in
and highly glazed; another from Gal&aacute;m, made of an earth which
was richly impregnated with little particles of gold. Trinkets made by
the natives from their own gold; knives and daggers formed from bar
iron; and various other articles, such as bags, dagger-sheaths,
quivers, gris gris, all of leather, of native manufacture, dyed of
various colours, and ingeniously sewed together. The fourth division
contained the instruments of confinement used on board a slave-ship, to
which were added those of punishment used in the colonies; such as iron
collars, manacles, scourges, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="first">Raynal gives the following description of the mode
frequently used in conducting the slaves from the interior:
&ldquo;Slave-merchants collect themselves into companies, and forming a
species of caravans, in the space of two or three hundred leagues, they
conduct several files of thirty or forty slaves, all laden with water,
corn, &amp;c. which are necessary to their subsistence in those barren
deserts through which they pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The manner of securing them without much incommoding their
march, is ingeniously contrived. A fork of wood, of from eight or nine
feet long, is put round the neck of each slave. A pin of iron,
rivetted, secures the fork on the back part, in such a manner that the
head cannot disengage itself. The handle of the fork, the wood of which
is very heavy, falls before, and so embarrasses the person who is tied
to it, that, although he hath his arms and legs at liberty, he can
neither walk nor lift up the fork. When they get ready for the march,
they range the slaves in a line, and support and tie the extremity of
each fork on the shoulder of the foremost slave, and proceed in this
manner from one to another, till they come to the first, the extremity
of whose fork is carried by the guide. Few restraints are imposed, that
are not felt by those who impose them; accordingly, in order that these
traders may enjoy the refreshment of sleep without uneasiness, they tie
the arms of every slave to the tail of the fork which he carries. In
this condition he can neither run away, nor make any attempt to recover
his liberty. These precautions have been found indispensable; because,
if the slave can but break his chains, he becomes free. The public
faith which secures to the proprietor the possession of his slave, and
which at all times delivers him up into his hands, is silent with
regard to the slave and a trader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reader,&rdquo; continues the animated historian, &ldquo;while
thou art perusing this horrid account, is not thy soul filled with the
same indignation as I experience in writing it? Dost thou not, in
imagination, rush with fury upon those infamous conductors? Dost thou
not break those forks with which these unfortunates are confined? and
dost thou not long to restore them to liberty?</p>

<p class="first">The profits of this nefarious trade are so large, that
mercenary men will incur any risk. At present, says the Report, 1822,
speaking of the French favouring the trade, the rate of insurance does
not exceed fifteen or twenty per cent, while the gains of the trade are
proved to amount to from two hundred to four hundred per cent. It
appears, from papers found on board Le Succ&egrave;s, that two hundred
and forty slaves, which she landed on the island of Bourbon, cost nine
thousand nine hundred and forty-three dollars; and that the proceeds of
the sale of these slaves amounted to twenty-nine thousand five hundred
and sixty-four dollars. And there is also an account of an outfit of
fifty-three thousand francs producing a net profit of one hundred and
sixty-six thousand francs.</p>
<p>These facts need no comment. But let not England be discouraged: she
has stood alone in many a fearful struggle, when apparently sinking
under the pressure of a hostile world. She has led the way in the work
of mercy; let her pursue her path with unfaltering firmness, and
fearlessly oppose those who dare to violate the solemn engagements they
have formed with her.</p>

*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SAMBOE; OR, THE AFRICAN BOY ***

***** This file should be named 37296-h.htm or 37296-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg (This book was produced from scanned images of
public domain material from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
